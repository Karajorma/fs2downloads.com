    This file describes the various items on the menubar at the top
    of the FRED2 screen.  The <a href=editors.html>Editors Menu</a>
    is not described here;  it's complicated enough to justify its own
    file.
    <p>
    Many of the menu items have hotkeys, which are listed in the menus.
    <p>
    The sections of this file are:

    <img src=file-menu.gif align=right hspace=10>
    This is a typical <b>File</b> menu, as found in most
    applications.  <b>New</b> creates a new, empty mission file.  <b>Open</b>
    opens a previously saved mission.  <b>Save</b> saves the current
    mission and <b>Save As</b> saves it with a new name.
    <p>
    <i>
    The most important thing to remember in FRED2, as in any other
    editor, is <b>SAVE EARLY AND OFTEN!</b>  There are few things more
    frustrating than losing hours of work to a crash, power failure,
    or editing error.
    </i>
    <p>
    Missions must be saved in the <code>data/missions</code>
    subdirectory of your main FreeSpace 2 directory; otherwise the game will
    not be able to find them.
    </font></i>
    <p>
    <b>Revert</b> cancels any changes made since you last saved the
    mission.  If you're not confident in your ability to do something,
    save the mission first and then <b>Revert</b> if you mess up.
    <p>
    <b>Run FreeSpace</b> runs the FreeSpace 2 game.  This is useful
    for testing your missions.
    <p>
    A list of recently-edited missions also appears on the <b>File</b>
    menu.  Clicking on one of these will load that mission.  (Clicking
    on the name of the current mission has no effect.)
    <p>
    Finally, <b>Exit</b> quits FRED2.
    <p>
    If a mission file becomes corrupted, you might be able to recover
    some of your lost work.  In Windows, open the
    <code>data\missions</code> subdirectory of your main
	  FreeSpace 2 directory.  You will see files named
	  <code>Backup.001</code> (most recent) through
	  <code>Backup.009</code>.  Try renaming these (with
	  <code>.fs2</code> extensions) and opening them in the
    FRED2.
    	  <p>
    These backup files only get updated when you <b>Save</b>.  If you
    started a fresh mission, worked for two hours without
    saving, and then had your computer crash, there's no hope of
	  recovery;  you'll have to start over.

    The first item on this menu is the ability to <b>Undo</b> your most
    recent action.  This action will be named;  in the picture at
    right, the most recent action was the creation of a new object.
    <p>
    If you <b>Undo</b>, you can then <b>Undo</b> your second most recent action, and
    so on.  (There is no redo.)
    <p>
    There are many actions that cannot be undone.  If you're going to
    do something tricky, save first!
    <p>
    <b>Delete</b> deletes all currently marked objects.  The hotkey
    for this (<code>Del</code>, reasonably enough) is probably worth
    remembering.
    <p>
    <b>Delete Wing</b> deletes the selected ship and any others in the
    same wing.
    <p>
    <b>Disable Undo</b> makes it impossible to <b>Undo</b>.  This may seem
    like a rather strange option.  It is there because <b>Undo</b> has
    to keep track of a "stack" of previous actions, which takes up
    memory.  When editing a complicated mission on a slow machine,
    disabling <b>Undo</b> may make FRED2 run faster.

    This menu contains many options for controlling what you see in
    the main FRED2 window.  If something is checked, you can see the
    specified information.  There are three reasons for turning
    anything off:
    <ul>
      <li>Some information is useful so rarely that it's not worth the
	  clutter.
      <li>Not displaying some objects can make it easier to manipulate
	  others.
      <li>On a slow machine, turning off some options (especially
	  <b>Show Ship Models</b>) can make FRED2 run faster.
    </ul>
    <p>
    You can show or hide the <a href=toolbar.html>Toolbar</a> and the
    <a href=concepts.html#status>Status bar</a>.
    <p>
    <b>Display Filter</b> is a submenu that lets you show or hide
    various types of objects.  (<b>Show Player Starts</b> shows ships
    which are flown by players.)
    <p>
    <b>Hide Marked Objects</b> makes all marked objects invisible.  To
    see them again, click on <b>Show Hidden Objects</b>.
    <p>
    <b>Show Ship Models</b> renders ships in all their 3D
    texture-mapped glory.  This is a great way to get a close,
    detailed look at FreeSpace 2's gorgeous models.
    <p>
    <b>Show Outlines</b> shows colored wire-frame outlines of ships.

<p>
If you have <b>Show Ship Models</b> selected, ships which are
marked or selected will have wire frames even if this option is turned
off.
<p>
If both <b>Show Ship Models</b> and <b>Show Ship Outlines</b>
are turned off, each ship will appear as a large, colored dot.
The dot indicates the center of the ship.  FRED2 still "imagines" that
the model is there, though, so you may have trouble clicking on a
nearby object;  the invisible ship model is "in the way".
<p>
<b>Show Ship Info</b> displays the name of each object, as well as a
code indicating its type.
<p>
<b>Show Coordinates</b> displays the <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, and <b>Z</b>
coordinates of each object.
<p>
If <b>Show Grid Positions</b> is checked, a line will be drawn between
each object and the grid.  This makes it easier to tell where objects
are located in three-dimensional space.
<p>
<b>Show Distances</b> is just like the <a href=toolbar.html#show-distances>Show Distances</a> button on the
<a href=toolbar.html>Toolbar</a>.
<p>
<b>Show Model Paths</b> displays the paths used by ships which are
approaching a ship to dock with it or attack a particular turret.
<p>
<b>Show Model Dock Points</b> displays the locations on a ship where
another ship can dock with it.
<p>
<b>Show Grid</b> displays a lattice of white lines that makes it easier
to "eyeball" coordinates.  There is an item in the <a href=#misc>Misc
Menu</a> for adjusting the grid.
<p>
<b>Show Horizon</b> displays a line all the way around the sky.  This
will be invisible if the grid is on in its default position.
<p>
<b>Double Fine Gridlines</b> and <b>Anti-Aliased Gridlines</b> make
the grid lines look a bit nicer.
<p>
<img src=3d-compass.gif align=right hspace=10>
<b>Show 3D Compass</b> displays red, green, and blue lines in the
upper right corner of the screen, below the camera position.  The red
line shows the direction of increasing <b>X</b> values, green
<b>Y</b>, and blue <b>Z</b>.
<p>
<b>Show Backround</b> displays the starfield and anything that has
been added with the <a href=editors.html#background>Background
Editor</a>.  This feature is a little flaky;  if it fails to update
properly, try saving your mission, restarting FRED2, and reloading the
mission.  Also, most background features (such as <a
href=editors.html#background>planets</a>) look better during the
mission than they do in FRED2.
<p>
<b>Viewpoint</b> lets you view the mission from the point of view of a
particular ship.  This is nice if you want to set up a majestic
opening view for the player.
<p>
In <b>Current Ship</b> view, the camera movement keys will move the ship.
Also if you have <b>Show Ship Models</b> on, your view may be
partially obstructed by parts of the ship you're "in".

    This menu contains a collection of miscellaneous items.
    <p>
    <b>Level Object</b> makes the camera (or object if in <a
    href=#view>Current Ship</a> view) level with the grid.  <b>Align
    Object</b> makes it parallel to the grid axes with as little
    rotation as possible.
    <p>
    <b>Mark Wing</b> marks all ships in the same wing with the
    currently selected ship, and selects the leader of that wing.

    <b>Control Object</b> makes the camera controls move the marked
    object(s) instead of the camera.

    <b>Next Object</b> and <b>Previous Object</b> cycle the selection
    through all objects in the mission.

    <img src=adjust-grid-dialog.gif align=right hspace=10>
    <b>Adjust Grid</b> brings up a dialog box for changing the
    orientation of the grid.  Newly placed ships will appear on the
    grid.  (With the setting shown at right, all newly placed ships
    will have an <b>X</b> value of 1000.)
    <p>
    <b>Next Subsystem</B> and <b>Prev Subsystem</b> cycle through the
    turrets on a ship;  this is a very good way to figure out which
    turret is which.  Pick <b>Cancel Subsystem</b> when you no longer
    need this option.
    <p>
    <b>Mission Statistics</b> shows some useful information about your
    mission as a whole.
    <p>
    The <b>Error Checker</b> checks the mission for various problems,
    such as wings with too many ships in them.  Ths is run
    automatically when you <a href=#file>Save</a> the mission, so you
    might as well just do that.
