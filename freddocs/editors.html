					    This editor lets you change the characteristics of an individual
					    ship.  By marking several ships, you can edit them all at once (for
					    example, turn them all hostile).
					    <p>
					    Many of the things that can be done with the <b>Ships Editor</b>
					    can also be done with the <a href=#wings>Wings Editor</a>.  When dealing with
					    wings, use the <a href=#wings>Wings Editor</a> whenever you have a choice.
					    <p>
					    At the upper left of this editor is a pull-down menu to let you
					    select a ship.  When you first open it, the <b>Ships Editor</b>
					    has all currently marked ships selected.  Any fields (such as
					    <b>Name</b>) which are not the same for all ships will be blank.
					    <p>
					    In the upper right are <b>Prev</b> and <b>Next</b> buttons, which
					    let you cycle through the ships in your mission.  <b>Delete</b>
					    deletes the currently marked ships, and <b>Reset</b> resets
					    everything in the <b>Ships Editor</b> to default values.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Main Area</h3>
					    <center><img src=ships-editor-main-area.gif></center><br>
					    You can change the <b>Name</b> and <b>Class</b> of a ship here.
					    <p>
					    You can also set skill the of AI (<i>A</i>rtificial
					    <i>I</i>ntelligence) controlling this ship.  Skill levels range
					    from Lieutentant to General.  Coward will attempt to evade.
					    None will react little and take no initiative.
					    <p>
					    There are four teams to which a ship can belong: Hostile,
					    Friendly, Neutral, and Unknown.  In a single-player mission, the
					    player is always Friendly.  By default, Hostile ships will attack
					    Friendly and Neutral ships.  Friendly ships will attack Hostile
					    and Neutral ships.  Neutral ships will attack Friendly ships.  (In
					    FreeSpace 1, the Hammer of Light was Neutral.)  Unknown ships will
					    neither attack nor be attacked by anyone (unless ordered to do
					    so).
					    <p>
					    <b>Cargo</b> indicates what, if anything, this ship is carrying.
					    This is used mostly for transports, of course.  The button at the
					    right side of this field lets you select from a list of cargoes on
					    other ships in this mission.
					<p>
					If you specify something in the <b>Alt Name</b> field, this will be
					shown as the ship's class in the player's HUD.  This way, the player
					can't tell what something is just by targeting it.
					    <p>
					    If this ship is part of a <b>Wing</b>, this is indicated.
					    <p>
					    <b>Hotkey</b> lets you assign a default hotkey for pilots to
					target this ship.  More than one ship can have the same hotkey;
					pressing it in flight will target all such ships.
					<p>
					F5 through F8 are generally reserved for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta
					wings.  You should use F9 through F12 for the ships the player is most
					likely to target:  freighters being escorted, stations being guarded,
					capital ships being attacked.
					<p>
					The player can alter their hotkey setup during the game.  (The default
					key for doing this is F4.)  If a ship's arrival is supposed to be a
					surprise, you don't want the player to see it when they do this.  In this
					situation, give the ship the hotkey Hidden.
					<p>
					<b>Persona</b> is used for fighters and bombers.  It determines which
					video and sound 
					clips are played for chatter from this ship.  There's really not too
					much difference between them, but note which are male and which are
					female;
					if you're going to have fighters send radio messages, they
					should match the automatic messages at least in gender.
					<p>
					<b>Score</b> is the number of points (toward promotion) the player
					earns for destroying this ship.  <b>Player Ship</b> is checked for
					ships flown by a player.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Weapons</h3>
					<center><img src=weapons-editor.gif vspace=10></center>
					<br clear=all>
					Pressing the <b>Weapons</b> button opens the <b>Weapons Editor</b>.
					Here, you can change the weapons mounted on the ship, as well as the
					AI class of each gunner.  (These are just the default settings.
					Players can be given some choice as to their weaponry with the <b>Team
					Loadout Editor</b>.)
					<p>
					Pilot is not a weapon mounting point;  this is just another way to set
					the pilot's AI class, equivalent to setting it in the main <b>Ships
					Editor</b>.
					<p>
					Some weapons cannot be mounted in some positions;  you can't put a
					capital ship beam weapon on a fighter.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Player Orders</h3>
					<img src=player-orders.gif align=right hspace=10>
					This dialog box lets you choose which orders a ship will accept from a
					player.  The example at right is for a fighter;  there will be fewer
					options for a capital ship, which does not have such a sophisticated
					AI.
					<br clear=all>
					    <h3>Special Explosion</h3>
					<center><img src=special-explosion.gif></center><p>
					This lets you provide an unusual explosion when and if this ship is
					destroyed.  <b>Damage</b> is the amount of damage taken by ships
					caught within the <b>Inner Damage Radius</b> of this ship when it
					blows.  The amount of damage decreases steadily out to the  <b>Outer
					Damage Radius</b>, where no damage is taken.  <b>Blast</b> determines
					how hard anyone caught in the explosion is pushed away from it.  The
					<b>Shockwave</b> is the blue visual effect seen on some large
					explosions.
					<br clear=all>
					    <h3>Additional Ship Properties (Misc)</h3>
					<img src=additional-ship-properties.gif align=right hspace=10>
					Pressing the <b>Misc</b> button brings up a dialog box.
					<p>
					You can
					have a ship destroyed a certain number of seconds before a mission
					(leaving debris).
					<p>
					If a ship is marked <b>Scannable</b>, the player can scan it the same
					way they would inspect a cargo vessel.  These are different things:
					scanning just changes the ship's status from Not Scanned to
					Scanned, but inspecting reveals the ship's cargo.  Any ship which
					does not have <B>Cargo Known</b> can be inspected.
					<p>
					If a ship is a <b>Reinforcement Unit</b>, it can be called into the mission by the
					player.
					<p>
					If you check <b>Protect Ship</b>, no AI-controlled ship will attack
					this one.  <b>Beam Protect
					Ship</b> merely prevents capital ship beams from targeting this ship.
					(These can 
					both be overriden by explicit beam firing orders, given with the
					<code>fire-beam</code> <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> operator.)
					<p>
					<b>Ignore For Counting Goals</b> takes this ship out of consideration
					in <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> operators like <code>percent-ships-destroyed</code>.
					<p>
					Any ship marked as an <b>Escort Ship</b> will show up in the <b>Monitor
					Display</b> on the right side of the player's HUD.  There is only room for
					three ships here, so FreeSpace 2 will pick the three escort ships with
					the highest priority values.  Any <a
					href=editors.html#asteroid-field>Asteroid</a> on a collision course
					with an escorted ship will be bracketed in white when the mission is played.
					<p>
					<b>No Arrival Music</B> disables the dynamic fanfare when this ship
					arrives.
					<p>
					A ship which is <b>Invulnerable</b> takes no damage, even from
					collisions.  This is useful for ships which have to survive for plot
					reasons, such as the SC Lucifer in FreeSpace 1.  It is also extremely
					useful in testing:  by making Alpha 1 invulnerable, you can fly around
					and watch the action without fear of being destroyed.  Don't forget to
					uncheck this when you're done with the mission!
					<p>
					A ship which is <b>Hidden From Sensors</b> will not show up clearly on
					radar and cannot be targeted.  It is still visible to the naked eye.
					<p>
					A <b>Kamikaze</b> ship will ram its target, destroying itself and
					doing the indicated amount of damage.
					<p>
					If <b>No Dynamic Goals</b> is checked, the ship will stick to its
					assigned orders.  Otherwise, it will stop to defend itself if it feels
					sufficiently threatened.
					<p>
					In a campaign, a mission can be designated as a Red Alert mission.
					(This is done in the <a href=#mission-specs>Mission Specs Editor</a>.)
					In
					this kind of mission, the player has not had the chance to return to
					their base ship for repairs.  Other ships in the previous mission with
					<b>Red Alert Carry Status</b> will be brought along into Red Alert
					mission.
					<p>
					When a player ship is destroyed in a multiplayer mission, the player
					will respawn near the ship with the highest <b>Respawn Priority</b>.
					<br clear=all>
					    <h3>Initial Status Editor</h3>
					<img src=initial-status-editor.gif align=right hspace=10>
					This dialog box lets you control various aspects of the ship's initial
					status.
					<p>
					<b>Velocity</b> is the ship's initial speed.  Note that ships may
					quickly change velocity to carry our orders or position themselves
					within wings.  Also, ships emerging from hyperspace have a high
					initial velocity regardless of how this is set.
					<p>
					If a ship is supposed to be damaged at the beginning of a mission,
					reduce its <b>Hull Integrity</b> below 100.  You can also adjust the
					integrity of individual subsystems, such as engines and turrets.  If
					you don't want to do all this by hand, consider using the
					<code>subsys-set-random</code> <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> operator.
					<p>
					Unchecking <b>Has Shield System</b> will render a fighter or bomber
					shieldless.  This box has no effect on larger ships.
					<p>
					If <b>Locked</b> is checked, the player cannot change the class or
					weapon loadout of the ship before launching the mission.
					<p>
					A ship can begin <b>Docked With</b> another ship, if they share
					appropriate docking point.  In some situations, you will have a choice
					as to where a ship will dock.  A ship can only be docked with one
					other ship at a time.  To see where the docking points are located,
					turn on <b>Show Model Dock Points</b> in the <a
					href=menus.html#view>View Menu</a>.
					<p>
					The field labeled <b>Cargo</b> here doesn't do anything.
					<br clear=all>
					    <h3>Initial Orders</h3>
					<center><img src=initial-orders.gif vspace=10></center>
					<br clear=all>
					Here you can specify what the ship is trying to do at the beginning of
					the mission.  New orders can be given later using the <a
					href=editors.html#events>Events Editor</a>.
					<p>
					The orders that can be
					given here are equivalent to those that can be given later with
					<a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXPs</a>, so we'll skip the detailed explanation for now.  We will
					note that the word Attack is used here where <code>chase</code> is
					used in the <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> operators.
					<p>
					Although there appears to be room for them, you can't give a ship more
					than 5 initial orders.  You can give additional orders using the <a
					href=editors.html#events>Events Editor</a>.
					<br clear=all>
					    <h3>Arrival and Departure Cues</h3>
					<center><img src=arrival-and-departure-cues.gif></center><p>
					Here you can control when the ship enters and leaves the mission.  By
					default, the ship is present when the mission starts, and never
					leaves.  If you want the <b>Ship Editor</b> window to be smaller,
					clicking on <b>Hide Cues</b> will toggle this part of it on or off.
					<p>
					Choices for <b>Location</b> are <code>Hyperspace</code>, <code>Near
					Ship</code>, <code>In Front Of Ship</code>, and <code>Docking
					Bay</code>.  If you choose anything but hyperspace, you must also
					select a <b>Target</b> ship to be near and a distance.
					<p>
					The <b>Cue</b> itself is a <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a>.  The ship will arrive or
					depart after this becomes true and then the number of seconds given in
					<b>Delay</b> has passed.
					<p>
					Check <b>No Warp Effect</b> if this would be inappropriate, such as
					when a fighter is launching from a destroyer or when a ship is
					appearing in the distance in a nebula.
					<p>
					The area at the bottom (which may extend below the edge of your
					screen) is the <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> help, explaining the currently highlighted
					<a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a>.  In the unlikely event that you want to turn this off,
					you can do so in the <a href=menus.html#help>Help Menu</a>.

					    This is very similar to the <a href=#ships>Ships Editor</a>,
					    but it allows you to edit properties of a wing.  If a control
					    appears in both editors, you should use the <b>Wings Editor</b>
					    for features which will be the same for all ships in a wing (such
					    as initial orders).
					    <p>
					    By turning <b># Of Waves</b> above 1, you can have more ships come
					    in whenever the wing gets down to the number of ships specified in
					    <b>Wing Threshold</b>.
					    <p>
					    You can also set the minimum and maximum
					    <b>Delay Between Waves</b> (in seconds) in the <b>Arrival</b>
					    panel.
					    Make the minimum high enough that it's not obvious that
					    these guys were just waiting in hyperspace for their last comrade
					    to die.  This is also a good way to give the player time to
					    reload between frenzied dogfights.  At the other extreme, don't
					    make the maximum delay so high that the player is flying around for
					    minutes waiting for something to happen.
					    <p>
					    By checking <b>No Arrival Message</b>, you can turn off the
					    message (such as "Beta wing here" or "New bandits incoming") that is normally sent when a new
					    wing arrives.
					    <p>
					    <b>Delete Wing</b> deletes all of the ships in the wing, and
					    <b>Disband Wing</b> deletes the wing but leaves the ships in place.

					    <p>
					    The <b>Name</b> of the objective is used in-flight, while the

					    objective valid later in the mission, create an <a

					    The <B>Events Editor</b> is the heart of FRED2.  This is where you
					    "script" your mission, setting up radio messages, HUD directives,
					    and other things that occur over the course of the mission.
					    <p>
					    There are really two areas of the <b>Events Editor</b>:  the
					    <b>Event Panel</b> on the left, dealing with events, and the
					    <b>Message Panel</b> on the right, dealing with messages.  (The
					    word "panel" is being used loosely here, as the two areas overlap
					    to some degree.)
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Event Panel</h3>
						<center>
					    <img src=events-editor-events.gif><p>
						</center>
					    The large white area in the upper left is for the various event
					    <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXPs</a>.  <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> help is given in the box at the bottom
					    of the <b>Events Editor</b> (not shown here).
					    <p>
					    <b>New Event</b> adds a new event to the end of the list.
					    <b>Insert Event</b> adds a new event just before the currently
					    highlighted one.  <b>Delete Event</b> deletes the highlighted
					    event.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <p>
					    An event can be made to occur several times by specifying a
					    <b>Repeat Count</b> (how many times it will happen) and an
					    <b>Interval Time</b> (number of seconds between repetitions).
					    For example, consider this event:
					    <br clear=all>
					    <img src=too-close.gif vspace=10>
					    <br clear=all>
					    Suppose this event has a <b>Repeat Count</b> of 5 and an <b>Interval
					    Time</b> of 10.  It will send a message from Command as soon as
					    Alpha 1 gets within 100 meters of the container, and again every
					    time Alpha 1 spends 10 seconds within 100 meters of the container.
					    (The message will be sent at most 5 times.)
					    <p>
					    The player can <b>Score</b> some points when this event occurs.
					    In a multiplayer mission, you must also specify which team scores
					    when this event occurs.
					    <p>
					    If an event is <b>Chained</b>, it will not occur until and unless
					    the one listed immediately before it has occurred.  If a <b>Chain
					    Delay</b> is specified, that many seconds must have passed since
					    the previous event.
					    <p>
					    <b>Directive Text</b> is given at the left side of the player's
					    HUD.  FreeSpace 2 is quite clever about this.  If
					    you set an event to occur when Kali wing has been destroyed, and
					    give <b>Directive Text</b> "Destroy Kali", the HUD will show the
					    number of ships left in Kali wing.
					    <p>
					Directives first appear in the HUD when it becomes possible for the
					player to bring about the event.  For example, if the event requires
					the destruction of some ship, the directive won't show up in the HUD
					until that ship arrives.  Also, if the event is chained, the directive
					won't show up until the previous event occurs.
					<p>
					If an event has <b>Directive Text</b>, the dot (or chain link) to the
					left of its name will be red instead of blue.
					<p>
					You can also specify the default key the player should press to bring
					about this event;  this is useful mostly in training missions.  In a
					training mission (see the <a href=#mission-specs>Mission Specs
					Editor</a>),
					if you
					surround the name of the key with dollar signs ("Press $spacebar$"),
					FreeSpace 2 will 
					automatically adjust if the player has remapped their keys.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Message Panel</h3>
					<img src=events-editor-messages.gif align=right hspace=10>
					A list of all of the <b>Messages</b> in the mission is shown in the
					upper right.  Use <b>New Msg</b> to create a new one, and <b>Delete
					Msg</b> to delete the highlighted message.

					For a
					message to actually be sent, you have to create a
					<code>send-message</code> event.  The source of the message can be a
					particular ship, or <code>#Command</code>.
					<p>
					The <b>Name</B> of a message is strictly for use within FRED2.
					<b>Message Text</b> is what appears at the top of the player's HUD.
					<p>
					<B>ANI File</b> is the animated "talking head" that appears at the
					upper left side of the player's HUD when this message is sent.
					<code>CM</code> stands for command, <code>TP</code> are Terran pilots,
					<code>VC</code> is Vasudan command, and <code>VP</code> is a Vasudan
					pilot.
					
					<p>
					Since you can't create your own <code>.ani</code> file, <b>Browse</b>
					isn't useful.
					<p>
					<B>Wave file</b> is the <code>.wav</code> file played with this
					message.  You can choose from the many built-in wave files, or select
					one of your own (which should be 
					placed in the <code>data\voice\special</code> subdirectory of your
					main FreeSpace 2 directory).  The button with the little triangle
					plays the selected wave file, but unfortunately it does not work for
					the built-in ones.
					<p>
					Several useful files are included in the
					<code>data\voice\special</code> directory:
					<p>
					    <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
					      <tr>
						<th align=left>File</th>
						<th align=left>Description</th>

					      </tr>
					      <tr>
						<td><code>vasudantalk.wav</code></td>
						<td>Long sample of Vasudan speech</td>
					      </tr>
					</table>
					<p>
					If you send a message with a wave file and FreeSpace 2 can't find the file,
					the message will just be run silently.
					<p>
					<b>Persona</b> indicates which "character" is speaking.  It
					corresponds to the the personas set in the <a
					href=editors.html#ships>Ships Editor</a>, and also allows choices like
					<code>Support Ship</code>.  Pick whichever one is appropriate.
					When you pick a new built-in wave file or click on
					<b>Update Stuff</b>, the <b>ANI File</b> and <b>Persona</b> are both
					updated to the correct values for that wave file.  If a fighter or
					bomber is going to send such a message, set the persona in the <a
					href=editors.html#ships>Ships Editor</a> to match so that chatter
					messages will have the same face and voice.

						The background editor lets you add stars, planets,
					    and nebulae to your mission.  (There is a separate editor for
					    <a href=editors.html#asteroid-field">Asteroid Fields</a>.)
					    <h3>Bitmaps</h3>
					    <img src="background-editor-bitmaps.gif"><p>
					    The <b>Bitmaps</b> panel lets you place planets, nebulae, and other
					    background images.
					    <p>
					    Click on <b>Add</b> to add a new image and <b>Delete</b> to delete
					    the currently highlighted image.  The field in the upper
					    right lets you choose from several dozen built-in images.
					    <code>dneb</code> stands for dark nebula, <code>neb</code> is nebula, and
					    of course <code>planet</code> is planet.
					    <p>
					    The next three fields determine the position and orientation of
					    the currently highlighted image.  <b>P</b> stands for pitch (degrees above the
					    horizon), <b>B</b> is bank (degrees of clockwise rotation), and <b>H</b> is
					    heading (degrees left along the horizon).  The default position (0,
					    0, 0) is straight ahead when you open FRED2.  These numbers all
					    range from 0 through 359.
					    <p>
					    The <b>Scale</b> fields let you make the image larger (for example, to
					    make a planet appear closer).  These range from 0.001 (one
					    thousandth normal size) to 18.  With a planet, these should be
					    equal;  otherwise, you'll get a goofy-looking elliptical planet.
					    <p>
					    The <b># divisions</b> fields determine how many sections the
					    bitmap is divided into for mapping onto the sphere of the sky.
					    These values range from 1 to 5, but you don't normally have to
					    mess with them.
					    Very large bitmaps (taking up half the sky) will not be rendered
					    properly unless the <b># divisions</b> fields are turned up to 2
					    or 3.  (Turning them any higher doesn't have any noticeable
					    effect.)
					    <p>
					    You can use your own bitmap images.  They should be
					    <code>.pcx</code> files, no larger than 256x256, and should be
					    placed in the <code>data\effects</code> subdirectory of your main
					FreeSpace 2 directory.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Suns</h3>
					    <img src="background-editor-suns.gif"><p>
					    The <b>Suns</b> panel lets you place bright, nearby stars.  It works
					    basically like the Bitmaps panel, but the <b>Scale</b> goes
					    from 0.1 to 50 here.
					    <p>
					If you don't put in any suns, you will get a default sun.  You can't
					get rid of it, but you can come fairly close by putting in one sun of
					scale 0.1.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <h3>Nebula</h3>
					    <img src="background-editor-nebula.gif"><p>
					    The <b>Nebula</b> panel is for missions that take place inside a
					nebula.  Check <b>Full Nebula</b> for such missions.
					<p>
					<b>Range</b> determines how far (in meters) radar can detect
					enemy ships.  Ships more than half this distance away will
						appear as faded blips on radar and cannot be targeted.
						<p>
						<b>Pattern</b> is a big background image, overriding any
						bitmaps.  <b>Poofs</b> are clouds swirling in front of the
						player.
						<p>
						<b>Lightning Storm</b> determines the strength of
					electromagnetic discharges within the nebula.
					<p>
					      <b>Pattern</b> and the other fields below the line in the Nebula panel
					don't do anything.
					<br clear=all>
					<h3>Misc</h3>
						<img src="background-editor-misc.gif"><p>
						The <b>Misc</b> panel lets you specify the number of stars (100 to
						2000) or set a mission in hyperspace.

					    <p>
					    The <b>Avg. Speed</b> of the asteroids is given in meters per
					    second.
					    <p>
					    FreeSpace 2 does not check for collisions between asteroids, so
					    they pass right through each other.  Don't make your field too
					    dense, or this will be noticeable.
					    <p>
					    The <b>Outer Box</b> settings give the boundaries of the field.
					    In an <b>Active Field</b>, you can also specify an <b>Inner
					    Box</b>.  No asteroids will appear here, and asteroids will not be
					    hurled at ships inside the inner box.  This is useful for hiding
					    an installation inside an asteroid field.

					    <p>
					    <b>Title</b> is the name of the mission, and the <b>Designer</b>
					    is you.
					    <p>
					    A mission can be <b>Single Player</b>, <b>Multi Player</b>, or
					    <b>Training</b>.  A <b>Multi Player</b> mission can be

					    You can't have a single mission work both for <b>Single Player</b>
					    and <B>Multi Player</b>, but you can have two different mission
					    files that differ only in this detail.
					    <p>
					    If you check <b>All Teams At War</B>, the rules described in the <a
					    href=#ships>Ships Editor</a> change:  now Neutrals and Unknowns
					    will also attack Hostiles.
					    <p>
					    A <b>Red Alert Mission</b> takes place right on the heels of
					    another one;  there is no return to base for repairs.  This is
					    mainly important in a campaign.
					    <p>
					    In a <b>Scramble Mission</b>, there is no opportunity for the
					    player to change their ship or weapon loadout.
					    <p>
					    If you <b>Disallow Support Ships</b>, the player cannot reload
					    their secondary weapons after the mission begins.  It would be a
					    very bad idea to check this option in a mission where the player
					    had to shoot down Shivan Dragon fighters.
					    <P>
					    If you <b>Disallow Promotions/Badges</b>, they player cannot earn
					    any such awards as a result of this mission.
					    <p>
					    <b>Max Respawns</b> is the number of "lives" each player gets in a
					    multiplayer mission.
					    <p>
					    <b>Music</b> indicates what music is played during the mission.
					<p>
					You can use <b>Squadron Reassign</b> panel to put the player in a particular
					squadron for the duration of this mission.  (This contrasts with their
					regular multiplay squadron.)  You can give the squadron a <b>Name</b>
					and specify what <b>Logo</b> will be painted on the side of the
					player's ship.
					<p>
					The <b>Mission Description</B> shows up when players highlight a mission
					from the list in the <b>Tech Room Mission Simulator</b> or when
					choosing a multiplayer mission.  <b>Designer's Notes</b> are for the

					    This editor lets you set up the story at the beginning of the
					    mission, describing the situation to the player and telling them
					    what to do.  Of course, there can always be surprises...
					    <p>
					    When you open the <b>Briefing Editor</b>, two things happen:  a very large dialog
					    box appears, and the main view shrinks to about a quarter of its
					    size.  The shrinkage is to remind you that, while the <b>Briefing
					    Editor</b> is open, the main view is used to place briefing icons.
					    That's explained below in the discussion of icons.
					    <P>
					    <img src=briefing-editor.gif align=right hspace=10>
					    In a multiplayer mission, first use the <b>Select Team</b> menu
					    to determine who gets this briefing.  (You'll need a briefing for
					    each team.)
					    <p>
					    A briefing consists of a series of stages, each of which has a
					    picture of the mission area and a paragraph of text.  <b>Add
					    Stage</b> adds a new stage at the end, <b>Insert Stage</b> adds a
					    stage right after the current one, and <b>Delete Stage</b> deletes
					    the current stage.  <b>Prev</b> and <b>Next</b> cycle through the
					    stages.
					    <p>
					    The large <b>Text</b> area is the text displayed at the bottom of
					    the player's screen as they watch the briefing.
					    <p>
					    The importance of good spelling and grammar here cannot be
					    overstated.  If you're weak in this area, find someone to

					    If you want to
					    produce a
					    <b>Voice Wave File</b>, put it in the
					    <code>data\voice\briefing</code> subdirectory of your main
					    FreeSpace 2 directory.  You can either type in the name or
					    <b>Browse</b> for it, and the little triangle will play it.
					    <p>
					    You can choose from a number of different <b>Briefing Music</b>
					    tracks.
					    <p>
					    The <b>Usage
					    Formula</b> is a <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> determining whether
					    this briefing stage will be used or not.  This will simply be
					    <code>true</code> in a single mission, but you may want to do
					    something more interesting in a campaign, perhaps involving <a
					    href=SEXP-2.html#operators>SEXP operators</a> like
					<code>is-previous-goal-true</code>.
					<p>
					Everything else has to do with the picture the player sees during the
					briefing.  This is set up in the main view.  The first thing you'll
					want to do is double-click on this (not on an object) to make it
					bigger.  (It still won't be full-sized, but it will be as big as it
					will be during the actual briefing.)
					<br clear=all>
					<img src=briefing-icons.gif vspace=10>
					<br clear=all>
					You can use the <a href=concepts.html#movement>camera movement
					controls</a> and many other standard FRED2 controls.  However, the
					player will only see those things for which you've created icons.
					<p>
					Having the icons and the actual objects visible at the same time can
					get pretty messy.  There are two ways around this:
					<ul>
					  <li>Turn off most of the features in the <a
					      href=menus.html#view>View Menu</a> such as <b>Show Ship
					      Models</b> and <b>Show Ship Info</b>.
					  <li>Move the camera to point at an empty area of space and create
					      your icons there, ignoring the actual mission objects.
					</ul>
					To make an icon, select a ship and then press <b>Make Icon</b>.  (If
					you're working out in empty space, you'll have to create an object,
					make an icon, and then delete the object.)  You can move an icon around
					just as you would an object.  You cannot rotate it, though, and it
					will not appear smaller if you move it farther away.
					<p>
					During the briefing, the player only sees icons and the grid.  If you
					don't make any icons, they'll just see a blank grid.
					<p>
					<b>Label</b> controls the text that appears right under the icon;
					this can be blank.  <b>Icon Image</b> determines which picture you
					get.  <b>Ship Type</b> controls what the player sees if they click on
					the icon during the briefing.  (If you didn't know about that feature,
					go start up a mission in FreeSpace 2 and click on an icon.  Neat,
					huh?)  <b>Team</b> determines the color of the icon (it will not
					change color here, just in the actual briefing).
					<p>
					The <b>Text</b> box at the bottom doesn't do anything.  This is a good
					thing, because it spills off the bottom of your screen anyway.
					<p>
					If you check <b>Highlight</b>, the current icon will be surrounded by
					a ring of rotating triangles during the briefing.
					<p>
					<b>ID</b> is just a number identifying the current icon.  There's no
					reason to mess with this.
					<p>
					If <b>Change Locally</b> is checked when you make a change (for
					exampe, to the <b>Icon Image</b> of an icon), that change will not
					affect other stages of the briefing.
					<p>
					You can delete the selected icon with <b>Delete Icon</b>.
					<p>
					Pressing <b>Propagate</b> causes all icons to appear, in their
					current positions, in all following briefing stages.  If you make a
					mistake in a stage, you can go back to the previous stage and press
					<b>Propagate</b> to reset the icons.
					<p>
					Shockingly, checking <b>Draw Lines Between Marked Icons</b> draws
					lines between the marked icons.
					<p>
					Returning to the top of the editor, <b>Save View</b> "takes the
					picture" for this briefing stage.  If you move the camera around and
					don't press <b>Save View</b>, the picture will not be from the angle
					you so carefully set up.  Don't forget to do this!
					<p>
					<b>Goto View</b> resets the camera to wherever it was the last time
					you pressed <b>Save View</b>.  You can use <b>Copy View</b> and
					<b>Paste View</b> to copy a camera angle from one briefing stage to
					another.
					<p>
					<b>Camera Transition Time</b> is the time in <i>milli</i>seconds that
					it takes the camera (during the actual briefing) to move from its
					current position to its position in the next briefing stage.
					<p>
					If you check <B>Cut To Next Stage</b>, you will get static rather than
					a camera pan between this stage and the next.  <b>Cut To Previous
					Stage</b> is similar, but would only come up if the player hit the
					<b>Back</b> button during the briefing.

					    <b>Menubar</b>, a <b>Campaign Diagram</b> on the right, and the
					    <b>Main Controls</b> on the left.
					    
					    <h3>Menubar</h3>
					    The <b>File</b> menu has the usual options.
					    <p>
					    The <b>Other</b> menu just contains an <b>Error Checker</b>.  This
					    is run automatically when you save a campaign.
					    <p>
					    The <b>Initial Status</B> menu lets you decide which ships and
					    weapons are available at the beginning of the campaign.  If a ship
					    or weapon is not checked (and most aren't by default), it will be
					    replaced with something else in any campaign missions that use it.
					    To make a ship or weapon available later in the campaign, create
					    <a href=#events>Events</a> using the <code>allow-ship</code> or
					    <code>allow-weapon</code> <a href=SEXP-2.html#operators>SEXP
					    operators</a>.
					
					    <h3>Campaign Diagram</h3>
					    <img src=campaign-diagram.gif align=right hspace=10>
					    On the right side of the <b>Campaign Editor</b> is a diagram of
					the current campaign.  To add a mission, first highlight it in the
					list of <b>Available Missions</b> on the left side of the editor;
					then Ctrl click in a gray box in the <b>Campaign Diagram</b>.
					Missions can be moved around by dragging them.
					<p>
					The order of missions in the campaign is determined by the links
					(lines) between them.  To create a link from one mission to the one
					that should follow it, drag it onto the following mission.  It must be
					placed <em>exactly</em> on top of the followimg mission;  you may have
					to drag the following mission left or right for this to be possible.
					<p>
					A mission can have more than one following mission, with the progress
					of the campaign determined by the player's actions.  This is explained
					in more detail in the subsection below on the <b>Main Controls</b>.
					<p>
					If you right click on a mission in the <b>Campaign Diagram</b>, a
					small menu will pop up.  <b>Remove Mission</b> removes the current
					mission from the campaign.  <b>Add A Repeat Link</b> makes it possible
					that the player will have to repeat this mission;  such links are not
					visible in the <b>Campaign Diagram</b>.  You should select <b>End Of
					Campaign</b> for any mission that does not have a following mission.
					<br clear=all>
					
					<h3>Main Controls</h3>
					<img src=campaign-editor-controls.gif align=right hspace=10>
					<b>Available Missions</b> lists those missions that are not already in
					a campaign.
					<p>
					You can specify a <b>Campaign Name</b> and the <b>Type</b> of the
					campaign (<code>single</code>, <code>multi coop</code>, or <code>multi
					teams</code>).
					<p>
					The <b>Campaign Description</b> is shown when this campaign is
					highlighted in the <b>Campaign Room</b> within FreeSpace 2.
					<p>
					The remaining options affect the currently highlighted mission in the
					<b>Campaign Diagram</b>.
					<p>
					<b>Briefing Cutscene</b> is really only for use by Volition's mission
					designers;  FRED2 doesn't provide a way to create your own cutscenes.
					<p>
					There are two choices for the appearance of the <b>Main Hall</b>
					within FreeSpace 2:  <b>Galatea</b> and <b>Bastion</b>.  (These were
					destroyers in FreeSpace 1.)  
					<p>
					<b>Branches</b> are a series of <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXPs</a> that
					determine which mission will follow this one.  When a mission is
					completed, FreeSpace 2 goes through these and takes the first branch
					for which the <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> returns <code>true</code>.
					The last branch (and no other branch) must have simply
					<code>true</code> for its <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a>.
					<p>
					When a branch is highlighted, you can move it around with <b>Move
					Up</b> or <b>Move Down</b>.  These are slightly flaky;  you may have
					to press them more than once.
					<p>
					Loops are optional branches in a campaign;  the player can decide
					whether to take the loop branch or continue with the main campaign.
					A branch may be designated as a loop by pressing <b>Toggle Loop</b>.  
					<p>
					<b>Realign Tree</b> tries to straighten up the <b>Campaign Diagram</b>
					so that it looks nicer;  it doesn't always help.
					<P>
					<b>Load Mission</b> loads the highlighted mission (in the <b>Campaign
					Diagram</b>) into FRED2.
					<p>
					<b>Close</b> closes the campaign editor.
					<p>
					There are two more areas, not shown in the picture here.  The first is
					for <a href=SEXP-2.html>SEXP</a> help.  The second, <b>Mission Loop
					Description</b>, is the text displayed when the player is given the
					option to take a loop branch.
