					  These three buttons determine what happens when you drag an object

					  If the first button (<b>Select</b>) is pressed, dragging the mouse

					  ships right where you want them, and don't want to accidentally move
					  something.
					  <p>
					  The second button (<b>Select and Move</b>) is pressed by default.
					  This lets you move objects by dragging them with the mouse.
					  <p>
					  The third button (<b>Select and Rotate</b>) lets you rotate objects
					  without changing their position.  The direction of rotation depends
					  on the <a href=#axis-constraints>Axis Constraints</a>.
					  <p>
					  The speed of movement and rotation is controlled by the <a

					  they were connected to each other by invisible sticks.  When it is
					  pressed, each object rotates without changing its position, sort of
					  like a marching band turning a corner.
					  <p>
					  The picture below shows three groups of GTC Fenrises.  The group on
					  the left has been rotated non-locally, while the group on the
					  right has been rotated locally.

					  FreeSpace 2 missions take place in three-dimensional space, but the
					  mouse can only control two dimensions at a time.  These buttons
					  determine which dimensions objects move along when you drag them with
					  the mouse.  For example, if <b>X</b> is pressed, you can drag a ship
					  along the <b>X</b> axis, but its <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b> positions
					  will not change.
					  <p>
					  If you have the <a href=#mouse-drag-mode>Mouse Drag Mode</a> set to
					  <b>Select and Rotate</b>, the axis constraints refer to the axes
					  <i>relative to the object in 
					  question</i>, not the normal location axes.  Rotating around the <b>X</b>
					  axis is pitching up and down, rotating around the <b>Y</b> axis is yawing
					  left and right, and rotating around the <b>Z</b> axis is rolling
					  left and right.

					  These buttons let you group ships (usually fighters) into wings, or
					  break up those wings.
					  <p>
					  The <b>Form Wing</b> button puts all of the marked ships into a
					  wing.  It pops up a dialog box asking for the name of the new wing.
					  If some of the
					  marked ships are already in a wing, you will be given the
					  opportunity to reform that wing, that is, redefine it to consist of the
					  currently marked ships.  When ships are grouped into a wing, their
					  names are changed to reflect this.
					  <p>
					  <b>Disband Wing</b> breaks up the marked wing.  The ships remain
					  where they are.
					  <p>
					  You can put as many as six ships in a wing.  If a fighter or bomber
					  wing is going to show up in the player's HUD, it can have at most
					  four ships.
					  <p>
					  The HUD wingmen status guage only supports Alpha, Beta, Gamma,
					  Delta, and Epsilon wings.  For a single-player mission, the player
					  must be Alpha 1.  You can't have a Gamma wing without a Beta wing,
					  and none of the first three can be reinforcements.
					  <p>
					  For cooperative multiplayer missions, the players
					  must be in Alpha, Beta, and Gamma wings.  For team vs. team
					  multiplayer missions, the players must be in Alpha and Zeta wings.
					  <p>
					  Ships in a wing want to stay together, and want to be in particular
					  positions within the wing.  If you place them differently, they may
					  crash into each other while maneuvering into place at the beginning
					  of the mission.  The picture
					  below shows the standard positions of the ships within a wing.

					  ship types in FreeSpace 2, as well as waypoints, jump nodes, and lone
					  asteroids.  (If you want an asteroid field, use the <a
					  href=editors.html#asteroid-field>Asteroid 
					  Field Editor</a>.)  The selected object type will be created when
					  you ctrl click with the mouse in the main area of the FRED2 window.
					  <p>
					  If you have a waypoint selected when you place a new waypoint, the new
					  one will be added to the same path (right after the selected one).
					  Otherwise, the new waypoint will be in a new path.
					  <p>
					  Lone asteroids aren't terribly useful;  ships and weapons fly right
					  through them.
					  <p>
					  The prefixes for the different ship classes generally indicate the government
					  that originally produced that class and the ship type.
					  For example, something with the prefix GTSG is a Galactic
					  Terran Sentry Gun.
