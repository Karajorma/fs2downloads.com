					    This file will walk you through the process of creating a large,

					  <div class="copy">
					  Before opening FRED2 to build a mission, it is worth spending some
					  time with a pencil and paper planning the mission.  What forces are
					  involved, and what are they trying to accomplish?  What events will
					  happen over the course of the mission?
					  <p>
					  On the other hand, you will inevitably make some changes as you
					  build the mission.  Perhaps you will discover that it is unbalanced
					  (the same side always wins), or that it takes too long.  These
					  things can usually be fixed by changing the exact number and type of
					  ships involved.
					  <p>
					  In this mission, the (single) player is defending a GTVA shipyard.
					  The shipyard consists of a GTI Arcadia and two GTI Ganymede
					  installations.  There is a GTD Orion destroyer docked in one of the
					  rings.  There are also some cargo containers and transports
					  scattered about.
					  <p>
					  The shipyard is attacked by the Neo-Terran Front.  There are
					  two parts to the attack.
					  <p>
					  In the first part, a pair of cruisers (a
					  GTC Leviathan and a GTC Aeolus) and some fighters come at the
					  shipyard.  They player and the other friendly fighters engage the
					  enemy fighters, while a GVCv Sobek corvette meets the cruisers in
					  beam combat.
					  <p>
					  This is just a diversion for the second part of the attack.  Having
					  drawn the GTVA forces to one end of the shipyard, the Neo-Terrans
					  bring in some transports (GTT Argo) full of marines to steal the docked
					  Orion-class destroyer.  The transports have their own escort
					  fighters, of course.
					  <p>
					  A very skillful player (or one who knows what's going to happen)
					  might be able destroy the transports quickly.  If this happens, the
					  NTF abandons the attack.
					  <p>
					  If the NTF marines manage to take over the destroyer, they bring its
					  engines on line and head for the local jump node.  They player must
					  disable and disarm it before it jumps out.

					  You'll begin by placing large, stationary objects like
					  installations.  Laying out the "terrain" for the mission will help
					  you decide where to place other things later.
					  <p>
					  Before starting, read about the <a href=editors.html#objects>Objects
					  Editor</a> and the <a href=editors.html#ships>Ships Editor</a>.
					  <p>
					  Now, open FRED2.  The Arcadia installation is at the center of the
					  action, to it makes sense to put this at location (0, 0, 0).  You'll
					  need to get the player away from that area, so drag the player's
					  ship a few kilometers away, to someplace like (0, 0, -3000).  While
					  you're at it, form a wing containing that ship and call it Alpha.
					  <p>
					  Place the objects listed in the table below.  Use the <a

					    </tr>
					  </table>
					  <p>
					  Ring 2 and the Relentless are protected so that the NTF won't shoot
					  at them.  (Shots at Ring 2 might hit the Relentless.)  If the
					  Relentless is taken over, GTVA ships shouldn't try to destroy it; the
					  protection will be helpful there, too.  Vulcan's Forge and the
					  Relentless are both escort ships, so their hull strength will show
					  up on the right side of the player's HUD.  The Relentless is
					  supposed to be off-line with just a skeleton crew, so it has
					  velocity zero, disabled engines (and hence no engine glow), and
					  orders to play dead.
					  Finally, we let the player target the Relentless by pressing F12.
					  <p>
					  Depending on your camera angle, the shipyard should now look
					  something like this:

					  2.  Save early and often!

					  While FreeSpace 2 is really about fighters and bombers, it would
					  just be a series of isolated dogfights if it were not for transports
					  and capital ships.  These larger ships provide obstacles, visual
					  variety, and plot points.  With FRED2, you can make these ships behave
					  intelligently (or at least appear to do so).
					  <p>
					  The shipyard mission will have four sequences of large ship
					  movement.  They are described below, in order of increasing
					  complexity.
					  <h3>Orbiting Transport</h3>
					  The first scripted sequence is a transport repeatedly flying
					  around a series of waypoints.
					  <p>
					  Place the objects listed below.
					  Remember that, to add a waypoint to a
					  path, the previous waypoint in the path has to be selected.

					      priority 50
					      </td>
					    </tr>
					  </table>
					  <p>
					  Save the mission and go watch the transport do its thing.  Notice
					  that it will keep travelling around the waypoints over and over;
					  this is the difference between <code>waypoints</code> and
					  <code>waypoints-once</code>.
					  <p>
					  If you get impatient while watching the GVT Amazonia, remember that
					  you can change the time scale during the mission;  the default keys
					  for this are &lt; and &gt; (don't forget to hold down Shift).  This
					  is very useful when scripting large ship movements.
					  
					  <h3>Freighter Grabbing Cargo and Jumping Out</h3>
					  The next bit of traffic in the shipyard is a freighter that docks
					  with one of the cargo containers and then jumps out.  Here is the
					  freighter:
					  <p>
					  <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
					    <tr>
					      <th align=left>Object</th>

					      </td>
					      <td valign=top>Initial orders: <code>dock</code>, TC-TRI 9,
					      cargo dock 01, cargo dockpoint, 50</td>
					    </tr>
					  </table>
					  <p>
					  We also need to tell the Pelican to warp out after it picks up the
					  cargo container.  To do this, we'll need a SEXP.  Go read about <a
					  href=SEXP-2.html>SEXPs</a> now.
					  <p>
					  Use this SEXP for the Pelican's <b>Departure Cue</b>:
					  <img src=pelican-departure.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Save the mission and go experience the unbridled excitement of
					  interstellar commerce.
					  
					  <h3>NTF Attack: Part 1</h3>
					  You're probably about ready for some combat now.  Never fear, you're
					  about to bring in the big guns.
					  <p>
					  Two NTF cruisers are going to warp in and attack Ring 1.  First,
					  just place these ships and give them attack orders.  (FRED2
					  may incorrectly claim that you're telling them to attack their own
					  team.  Ignore this;  it happens because some details don't get
					  updated until you close the <b>Ships Editor</b>.)
					  <p>
					  <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
					    <tr>
					      <th align=left>Object</th>

					    <tr>
					      <td valign=top>NTC Munin</td>
					      <td valign=top>GTC Aeolus</td>
					      <td valign=top>5100, 2800, 4200
					      </td>
					      <td valign=top>Hostile<br>
					      Initial orders: <code>attack</code> Ring 1,
					      priority 50<br>
					      Escort ship, priority 50<br>
					      Hotkey: F10
					      </td>
					    </tr>
					  </table>
					  <p>
					  Save the mission.  If you try it out, you will notice several things
					  wrong:
					  <ul>
					    <li>The attacking ships are present right at the beginning of the
						mission.
					    <li>They don't stay together;  the Munin moves much faster than
						the Hugin.
					    <li>They don't use their beam weapons.
					  </ul>
					  To fix these problems, you'll have to use events.  Go read about the
					  <a href=editors.html#events>Events Editor</a> now.
					  <p>
					  First, you want the enemy ships to arrive a short while after the
					  mission starts.  You could do this by directly adjusting their
					  <b>Arrival Cues</b> in the <b>Ships Editor</b>.  It is a better idea
					  to create an event for the arrival of the NTF, and have the ships
					  arrive when this event occurs.  This way, if you decide to change
					  the arrival time, you can do it in one place, rather than editing a
					  bunch of different ships.  Also, you can have the event happen
					  almost immediately
					  when you're testing things out, then later move it back to a more
					  reasonable time.
					  <p>
					  Create this event:
					  <img src=force-1-arrival.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Use this SEXP for the <b>Arrival Cue</b> on each of the NTF
					  cruisers:
					  <img src=force-1-arrival-true.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Now for the speed problem.  You can limit a capital ship's speed
					  when it is flying waypoints.
					  <p>
					  Create a couple of waypoints, making sure they're on different paths.
					  <p>
					  <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
					    <tr>
					      <th align=left>Object</th>
					      <th align=left>Class</th>
					      <th align=left>Position</th>
					      <th align=left>Notes</th>
					    </tr>
					    <tr>
					      <td valign=top>Waypoint 2:1</td>
					      <td valign=top>Waypoint</td>
					      <td valign=top>3100, 900, 600
					      </td>
					      <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
					    </tr>
					    <tr>
					      <td valign=top>Waypoint 3:1</td>
					      <td valign=top>Waypoint</td>
					      <td valign=top>3100, 800, 200
					      </td>
					      <td valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
					    </tr>
					  </table>
					  <p>
					  Change the Hugin's initial orders to <code>waypoints-once</code>,
					  Waypoint path 2, priority 50.  Similarly, have the Munin head for
					  Waypoint path 3.  For good measure, use the <b>Objects Editor</b> to
					  point each of these ships at the waypoint to which it's going.
					  <p>
					  Now, you can create an event that will slow down the Munin and free
					  the beam weapons on both cruisers.  (Beam weapons are locked off by
					  default.)  You'll need to use <b>Add Operator</b> to do it:
					  <img src=cruiser-adjustments.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Save the mission and test it.
					  <p>
					  This is a good time to make Alpha 1 <b>Invulnerable</b>, so you can
					  watch the action without fear of being destroyed.
					  <p>
					  A one-sided capital ship battle isn't very interesting, so it's time
					  to bring the GVCv Pomotep into the action.  Since the cruisers are
					  faster, we can't just order the corvette to attack them.  However,
					  we can have it head for a waypoint near theirs, which will look just
					  as good to the player.
					  <p>

					  <p>
					  Add this event:
					  <img src=pomotep-intercepting.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Now the Pomotep will move the "intercept" the cruisers 30 seconds
					  after they arrive.
					  <p>
					  To make the story more interesting, let's say the Pomotep has
					  recently returned from battle.  In the <b>Ships Editor</b>, set its
					  hull strength to 82.  You could go through and damage each of
					  the various subsystems, 
					  but there's a better way.  Insert this event at the beginning of the
					  event list:
					  <img src=pomotep-initial-status.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  This will randomly set the strength of each of the Pomotep's
					  subsystems to somewhere between 25 and 100 percent.
					  <p>
					  Save the mission and go enjoy the fireworks.
					  
					  <h3>NTF Attack: Part 2</h3>
					  The last (and most complicated) scripted sequence in this mission is
					  the NTF transports responsible for capturing the GTD Relentless.
					  <p>
					  These transports will be in a wing, so you'll need to read about the
					  <a href=editors.html#wings>Wings Editor</a>.
					  <p>
					  Place four GTT Argo transports around position (-2000, -2000, 1000)
					  and group them into Sleipner wing.  You can set some things, such as
					  the <b>Hotkey</b>, in the <b>Wings Editor</b>.  For other things,
					  like cargo, you'll have to mark all four ships and then use the
					  <b>Ships Editor</b>.

					  <p>
					  Create an event called "NTF force 2 arrival cue".  Make the SEXP identical to "NTF
					  force 1 arrival cue" by using <b>Copy</b> and <b>Paste</b>.  (We'll
					  change the time on this event later.)  Set the
					  <b>Arrival Cue</b> for Sleipner wing so that they arrive when this
					  event becomes true.  Be sure to do this in the <b>Wings Editor</b>,
					  not in the <b>Ships Editor</b>.
					  <p>
					  Give Sleipner 1 (but <em>not</em> the other Sleipner ships) initial
					  orders to dock with the GTD Relentless.  Only one ship can dock with
					  the Relentless at a time, so the others will have to take their
					  turns.
					  <p>
					  The next bit of SEXP wrangling is a little complicated, so this is a
					  good time to save the mission.
					  <p>
					  Suppose it takes two transports full of marines to take over the
					  Relentless.  If this happens, there's no way to know in advance
					  which two transports will be responsible;  perhaps the player will
					  destroyer Sleipner 2, but Sleipner 1 and Sleipner 3 will
					  successfully dock.  You need a way to keep track of <em>how many</em>
					  transports have docked.
					  <p>
					  Fortunately, FRED2 lets you store values like this in variables.
					  Right click on any event in the <b>Events Editor</b> and select
					  <b>Add Variable</b>.  Call the new variable <code>DockCount</code>,
					  and give it a default value of 0.
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=add-variable.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Now, when Sleipner 1 finishes its work (say, 10 seconds after it has
					  docked), it should do the following:
					  <ul>
					    <li>Transfer its cargo to the GTD Relentless
					    <li>Get new orders to undock and warp out
					    <li>Add 1 to the value of <code>DockCount</code>
					  </ul>
					  Here's the event to do all that:
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=sleipner-1-done.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Sleipner 2 should move in as soon as Sleipner 1 either is destroyed
					  or finishes its job:
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=sleipner-2-going-in.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Create two more events, "Sleipner 3 going in" and "Sleipner 4 going
					  in".  These must appear right after "Sleipner 2 going in", and be
					  <b>Chained</b> so that they will happen in order.  (Without
					  chaining, Sleipner 4 would head in as soon as Sleipner 3 was
					  destroyed, regardless of whether one of the other two transports was
					  already docked with the GTD Relentless.)  Make liberal use of <b>Copy</b> and <b>Paste</b>, but don't forget to edit
					  the SEXPs so that each one refers to the correct ships within
					  Sleipner wing.
					  <p>
					  Create three more events:  "Sleipner 2 done",
					  "Sleipner 3 done", and "Sleipner 4 done".  These are basically
					  identical to "Sleipner 1 done", except that each refers to a
					  different transport in the <code>has-docked-delay</code>,
					  <code>transfer-cargo</code>, and <code>add-goal</code> sub-SEXPs.
					  <p>
					  Save the mission and test it.  You may want to fly a bomber so that
					  you can blow up one of the transports and watch the next one go in.
					  You might also try scanning one, and noticing that its cargo changes
					  just before it undocks from the Relentless.
					  <p>
					  Okay:  the transports are doing their little dance now, but it's not
					  having any effect on the GTD Relentless.  Time to change that.
					  <p>
					  After the first transport is done, the Relentless should change from
					  Friendly to Unknown.  This will make it appear purple rather than
					  green on the player's radar.  After a second load of marines, the
					  destroyer should become Hostile.  Also, its <code>play dead</code>
					  order should be cleared;  the NTF marines are using the Relentless'
					  weapons to help with the space battle.  The Relentless' beams will
					  stay locked;  the story is that they haven't been installed yet.
					  <p>
					  Two events will take care of all this:
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=relentless-boarded.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  After another 45 seconds, the marines get the Relentless' engines
					  back on line and head for the jump node.  To make the destroyer
					  appear to jump out in the jump node, you'll need to add a waypoint
					  on the near side.  (For a smaller ship, you could put the waypoint
					  inside the jump node.)
					  <p>

					  <br clear=all>
					  Change the Relentless' <b>Departure Cue</b> to:
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=relentless-departure.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Save the mission and try it out again.  Target the GTD Relentless
					  and use 'S' to cycle through subsystems until the engines are
					  targeted.  Watch the Relentless change from Friendly to Unknown to
					  Hostile.  If you're behind it, you'll be able to see the destroyer's
					  engines fire up as it heads for the jump node.
					  <p>
					  Have a few GTVA personnel get off the Relentless in an escape pod:
					  <p>
					  <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
					    <tr>
					      <th align=left>Object</th>
					      <th align=left>Class</th>

					      Initial orders:  <code>warp</code>, priority 50<br>
					      Escort ship, priority 100
					      </td>
					    </tr>
					  </table>
					  <p>
					  The escape pod will probably be shot down by the relentless, but it
					  might escape if there are friendly fighters in the area distracting
					  the destroyer.
					  <p>
					  Sleipner wing has no reason to stick around once the GTD Relentless
					  is captured.  Change the <b>Departure Cue</b> for Sleipner wing to
					  that they'll leave as soon as the event "Relentless pulling out"
					  becomes true.  (This event is used, instead of "Relentless
					  captured", so that none of the transports are docked with the
					  destroyer when they jump out.  Otherwise, they'd carry the destroyer
					  with them into hyperspace!  While the NTF might like this outcome,
					  it's not realistic.)
					  <p>
					  There are several possible outcomes to the mission:
					  <ul>
					    <li>Sleipner wing might lose so many ships that they can't take
						over the Relentless
					    <li>The Relentless might be destroyed
					    <li>The Relentless might be successfully stolen
					    <li>The Relentless might be taken over, but then disabled and
						disarmed
					  </ul>
					  As soon as any of these things happens, any other NTF ships should
					  leave.
					  <p>
					  Here are events for the first three possibilities:
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=relentless-outcomes.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  For reasons that will become clear when you add <a
					  href=#directives>directives</a>, the last case should be handled by
					  two separate, chained events.  Use <b>Insert Event</b> to add these
					  two events right after "Relentless pulling out", and make sure they
					  are <b>Chained</b>:
					  <br clear=all>
					  <img src=relentless-chained.gif vspace=10 align=left>
					  <br clear=all>
					  Add one more event, "Relentless out of picture", which becomes true
					  as soon as <em>any</em> of "Sleipner thwarted", "Relentless
					  destroyed", "Relentless escaped", or "Relentless disarmed" becomes
					  true.  (Hint:  you'll need to use an <code>or</code> with four
					  arguments.)  Make this the <b>Departure Cue</b> SEXP for each of the
					  NTF cruisers.
					  <p>
					  Save and test the mission.  Notice that the cruisers jump out as
					  soon as fate of the Relentless is decided.
					  <p>
					  Heave a sigh of relief that the hard part is over.  Take a break,
					  give your eyes and hands a rest, and talk to another human if one is
					  available.  When you're ready, come back and finish the walkthrough.

					  In the heat of combat, it's very hard to tell what's going on

					  Before adding the messages, this is a good time to make the NTF
					  forces show up when they should.  Have the first NTF force arrive 23
					  seconds into the mission, and the second one 137 seconds in.
					  <p>
					  The first message is the scramble order when the first NTF force
					  arrives.  Create a message called "Incoming!", with the text
					  "Incoming ... Neo-Terran Front!  Two cruisers and some fighters.

					  Fighters and bombers are added at this late stage for two reasons:
					  <ul>
					    <li>It's important to make sure that any capital ship combat is
						well-balanced first;  the fighters and bombers should be the
						deciding factor.
					    <li>It's very difficult to test other aspects of the mission while
						dogfighting.
					  </ul>
					  The first wing to consider, of course, is Alpha wing.  Before
					  placing the rest of them, move Alpha 1 to about (3400, 1600,
					  -2000) and point it toward GTI Vulcan's Forge.  Using <b>Current Ship
					  </b> viewpoint (in the <b>View Menu</b>), see what the shipyard looks like
					  from Alpha 1's point of view.  Move the ship around a bit to set up
					  a nice picture.
					  <p>
					  Now break up Alpha wing and add three more fighters behind it.
					  Select them all and change them to GTF Erinyes.  Here's the full

					  The initial orders will make the other ships in Alpha wing stay near

					  The remaining changes to the mission will not affect balance.  Now
					  is the time to make sure it's not too hard or too easy.  You might try
					  setting the difficulty one notch higher than you normally do;  after
					  all, you have the unfair advantage of knowing what's going to
					  happen.  Also, don't forget to turn off Alpha 1's invulnerability!
					  <p>
					  If the mission seems out of balance, try adding or removing some fighters.

					  Go back to stage 1.  In the main view, move the camera so that you
					  can see GTI Vulcan's Forge and both docking rings.  Zoom in so that
					  you can just see the center installation. Create an icon
					  for it (making sure it has <b>Icon Image</b>
					  <code>Installation</code>), highlight the icon, and save the view.
					  <p>
					  In stage 2, zoom out until both docking rings are in view.  Create

					  the <b>Ship Type</b> to <code>GTD Orion</code>.  Highlight the icon
					  and save the view.
					  <p>
					  In stage 3, create an icon for the GTD Relentless and highlight it.
					  Also, create an icon for the GVCv Pomotep.  (It may be easier to
					  create an icon for some other object, then modify its <b>Label</b>,
					  <b>Icon Image</b>, and so forth to correspond to the Pomotep.)
					  Place the Pomotep icon near the icon for the Relentless.  Save the
					  view.
					  <p>
					  For stage 4, move the camera so that you can see the jump node.
					  Create an icon for it.  Create another icon nearby, labeled
					  "Neo-Terran Front", with <b>Icon Image</b> <code>Unknown Wing</code>
					  and <b>Team</b> Hostile.  Save the view.
					  <p>
					  For stage 5, move back to where you can see GTI Vulcan's Forge.  If
					  necessary, delete any other icons.  Place an icon for Epsilon wing
					  nearby ("Epsilon", <code>Bomber Wing</code>, GTB Artemis).  Mark
					  both icons (by shift clicking) and check <b>Draw Lines Between
