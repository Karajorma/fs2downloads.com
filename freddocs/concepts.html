					    <ul>
					      <li> <a href=#cartesian>Cartesian Coordinates</a>
					      <li> <a href=#movement>Movement Commands</a>

					  <div class="copy">
					  The position of each object (ship, jump node, etc.) in FRED2 is
					  given by three numbers, called 
					  <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, and <b>Z</b>.  When you first start FRED2, the
					  default ship is at 
					  position (0, 0, 0).  This point is called the origin.
					  <p>
					  From the starting point of view, <b>X</b> indicates how many meters to the
					  right of the origin an object is.  If an object is to the left of
					  the origin, it will have a negative <b>X</b> value.
					  <p>
					  Similarly, <b>Y</b> indicates how many meters up the object is, and <b>Z</b>
					  indicates how many meters it is back into the screen.
					  <p>
					  The coordinates of the camera are shown in the upper right of the
					  FRED2 window.

					There are several modes which make these commands do different things:
					<a href=menus.html#view>Current Ship</a> view,
					<a href=toolbar.html#rotate-around-object>Rotate Around Object</a>,
					and
					<a href=menus.html#misc>Control Object</a> mode.

						<p>
						<div class="copy">
					    Many commands refer to the currently selected or marked objects.
					    The difference is subtle, but important.  Only one object can be
					    selected at a time, but several objects can be marked.
					    <p>
					    The currently selected object, if any, gets a white outline.  Other
					    currently marked objects get gold outlines.  In the picture at
					    right, the GTC Curly is selected.  The GTCs Curly, Larry, and Moe
					    are all marked.  The GTC Shemp is neither selected nor marked.
					    <p>
					    When more than one object is marked, many commands (including
					    movement and rotation) 
					    affect all of them as a group.  If you just want to move one
					    ship, make sure nothing else is marked!
					    <p>
					    The words "selected" and "marked" are not used entirely
					    consistently throughout FRED2.  For example, the <a href=toolbar.html#select-list>Select List</a>
					    button should probably be called Mark List.

					    The status bar is at the bottom of the screen.  It tells you how

					    the <a

					    you have made any modifications to your mission since last saving
