					    This tutorial will walk you through building the simplest of all
					    possible missions:  a one-on-one fighter duel.  This will be a
					    bare-bones mission (for example, it will have no briefing), but you'll
					    be playing it in less than two minutes.
					    <p>
					    <img src="FRED2-opening.gif" hspace=10>
					    First, launch <code>Fred2.exe</code>.  It's in the same directory
					    as the main freespace program.  The screen should look something
					    like the picture at right.
					    <p>    
					    The green ship you see is the player.  The player has to be
					    called Alpha 1, so you have to put that ship into Alpha wing.
					    <p>
					    To do that, first click on the ship or drag a rectangle around it
					    with the mouse.  The ship should
					    turn from green to white.
					    <p>
						
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td><img src="toolbar-form-wing.gif" align= hspace=10></td>
								<td><div class="copy">Now, find the button that looks like this, near the top center of the screen.<br>  Click it once.</div></td>
							</tr>
						</table>
					   
					   
						
					    <p>
					    A dialog box pops up.  Type <code>Alpha</code> and click
					    <b>OK</b>.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <p>
					   <table>
					   	<tr>
							<td valign="top"> 
								<div class="copy">
										Now we need an opponent.  Find this selection box, a little bit to
								    the right of that button.  Click on the little triangle on the
								    right side and a menu will pop up.  Scroll down and pick <code>SF
								    Mara</code>.  (It will be in red.)
								</div>
							</td>
							<td valign="top"> <img src="empty-selection-box.gif" hspace=10></td>
						</tr>
					   </table>
					   
					    <p>
					    <img src="quickstart-placement.gif" align=right hspace=10>
					    Holding down the Ctrl key, left click on the grid about 300 meters in
					    front of Alpha 1.  This will create an SF Mara, which is hostile
					    by default.  The main part of the FRED2 window should look like
					    the picture at right.  (The grey information rectangle will
					    disappear if you move the mouse.)
					    <p>
					    Okay, that's it!  Time to save the mission and give it a try.
					    <p>
					    Pick <b>Save As...</b> from the <b>File Menu</b>.  Call the mission
					    <code>duel.fs2</code>.  Do not change directories;  all missions
					have to go in a certain directory, and FRED2 puts them there by
					default.  
					    <p>
					    Finally, pick <b>Run FreeSpace</b> from the <b>File Menu</b>.  Go to the
					    <b>Tech Room</b>, choose the <b>Mission Simulator</b>, and check <b>Single
					    Missions</b>.
					    <p>
					    Your mission should appear as <code>untitled</code>.  Jump in your
					ship and blast that Shivan fighter!
					<br clear="all">
