				    <i><b>NOTE:</b>  
				    Before playing with FRED2, you are strongly encouraged to complete
				    the main FreeSpace 2 campaign.  Certain surprises may be spoiled
				    otherwise.
				    </i>
				    <p>
				    Welcome to FRED2, the mission editor for FreeSpace 2.  This
				    powerful, easy-to-use program lets you create your own FreeSpace 2
				    missions and campaigns.
				    <p>
				    The help is divided into the following files:
				    <ul>
				      <li> <a href=quickstart.html>Quick Start</a> walks you through
					  designing a simple
					  mission.  It will probably take less than two minutes.
				      <li> <a href=concepts.html>Basic Concepts</a> explains things like moving the camera and
					  placing ships.
				      <li> <a href=toolbar.html>The Toolbar</a> covers the buttons
					  near the top of the FRED2 window.
				      <li> <a href=menus.html>Menu Commands</a> explains the various pull-down menus, except
					  for the Editors menu.
				      <li> The <a href=walkthrough.html>Extended Walkthrough</a> shows you how to create a
					  detailed, polished mission.
				      <li> The <a href=editors.html>Editors</a> are explained
					  in a separate section.
				      <li> <a href=SEXP-2.html>Working With SEXPs</a> explains how to use FRED2's
					  <i>s</i>ymbolic <i>exp</i>ressions, which control events,
					  ship arrival cues, and many other things.
				      <li> <a href=internet.html>Internet Links</a> points you to
					  resources for getting help, learning more, and sharing
					  missions with others.
				      <li> Use the <a href=index-no-really.html>Index</a> to quickly
					  find the right place to do just about anything in FRED2.
				    </ul>
				    
				    These help files are made for reading in a web browser.  You can have FRED2
				    and your browser open at the same time;  use Alt-Tab to switch
				    quickly between them.  Since there are many screenshots, you will
				    probably want to turn on "automatically load images".  Of course,
				    you can print out the help files if you wish.
				    <p>    
				    If you are new to designing FreeSpace missions, begin with the
				    <b>Quick Start</b>.  Read the next three sections (don't worry, they're
				    short), then do the <b>Extended Walkthrough</b>.  You'll learn
				    about the <b>Editors</b> and <b>SEXPs</b> along the way.  Finally,
				    check out the <b>Internet Links</b>.
				    <p>
				    If you are experienced with the original FRED, read through the
				    <b>Extended Walkthrough</b>;  you might learn something new.  Have a
				    look at the list of operators in <b>Working With SEXPs</b>.
				    Finally, skim over the <b>Index</b> and follow the link to
				    anything that looks interesting.
