					    This file explains how to use SEXPs, or <i>s</i>ymbolic
					    <i>exp</i>ressions, to program complex behavior into your
					    missions.  (It's pronounced "sex pee".  Stop snickering!)
					    <p>
					    While FRED2's SEXPs are easy to use, they
					    are enormously powerful.  These help files only begin to touch on
					    the possibilities;  the <a href=internet.html>on-line FreeSpace 2
					    community</a> will no doubt use SEXPs to do things the designers of
					    FreeSpace 2 never imagined.
					    <p>
					    The sections of this file are:

					  SEXPs are used to control the events that occur within a FreeSpace 2
					  mission.
					    They are used in the <a
					    href=editors.html#ships>Ships</a>,
					    <a href=editors.html#wings>Wings</a>,
					    <a href=editors.html#mission-objectives>Mission Objectives</a>,
					    <a href=editors.html#events>Events</a>,
					    <a href=editors.html#briefing>Briefing</a>,
					  <a href=editors.html#debriefing>Debriefing</a>, and
					  <a href=editors.html#campaign>Campaign</a> editors.
					  <p>
					  A SEXP examines the state of the mission (which ships have
					  been destroyed, how much time has passed, what cargo has been
					  inspected, and so forth).  Based on this information, the SEXP
					  either does something (like turning a friendly ship hostile) or returns
					  (computes) some value.  Most SEXPs return a "boolean" true-or-false value, but
					  some return a number or a text string.  You can use this returned value to
					  trigger events, such as radio messages and ship arrivals.
					  <p>
					  For example, you can tell a ship to warp in 15 seconds after the GTT
					  Patterson departs by putting putting the SEXP below in the
					  <b>Arrival Cue</b> section of the <a href=editors.html>Ships</a>
					  editor.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <img src=sexp-example.gif vspace=10>
					    <br clear=all>
					    This SEXP is composed of an
					    operator (<code>has-departed-delay</code>) and two arguments
					    (<code>15</code> and <code>GTT Patterson</code>).  The number of
					    arguments can vary.
					    <p>
					    You can
					    recognize the operator by the red <font color=red>op</font> next
					    to it.  The little sheets of paper next to the other lines
					    indicate that they are plain data.
					    <p>
					    Here's a more complicated one:
					    <br clear=all>
					    <img src=sexp-example-2.gif vspace=10>
					    <br clear=all>
					    This SEXP becomes true when 75% of
					    Beta wing has been destroyed and the SC Hastur has been disabled
					    (for at least 0 seconds).  The main operator of this SEXP is
					    <code>and</code>;  its arguments are themselves SEXPs, sometimes
					    called sub-SEXPs.
					<p>
					    If you click on the little minus sign to the left of an operator,
					    its arguments are hidden and the minus sign turns into a plus.
					    <br clear=all>
					    <img src=sexp-compressed.gif vspace=10>
					    <br clear=all>
					    Click on it again to show the arguments.
					    <p>
					    Whenever you highlight an operator (by clicking on it), help
					    appears at the bottom of the editor explaining how that operator
					    works.  Here is the help for <code>has-departed-delay</code>:<p>
					    <br clear=all>
						<table width=100% border=0 bgcolor=#B0B0B0>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<div class="copy">

					    You can turn SEXP help off by unchecking <b>Show SEXP Help</b> in
					the <a href=menus.html#help>Help Menu</a>.
					<p>
					<img src=sexp-right-menu.gif align=right hspace=10>
					To edit a line in a SEXP, right click on it.  You'll see a menu like
					the one shown at right.  Different items will be grayed out depending
					on the situation.
					<p>
					<b>Delete Item</b> deletes the current line and any sub-SEXPs under
					it.  For example, if you delete an operator, its arguments will also
					get deleted.
					<p>
					<b>Edit Data</b> is used to edit lines containing raw data, like
					numbers and text strings.
					<p>
					<b>Expand All</b> shows the arguments of the current operator.  It's
					similar to clicking on the minus sign to the left of the operator, but
					it also expands any sub-SEXPs.
					<p>
					<b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b>, and <b>Paste</b> work just as you'd expect.
					<b>Add Paste</b> adds whatever SEXP is on the clipboard (the one most
					recently cut or copied) as an additional argument to the current
					operator.
					<p>
					<b>Add Operator</b> adds a new operator as an argument to the current
					operator.  (It gives you a huge menu of operators to choose from;
					more on those in a moment.)  <B>Add Data</b> lets you add a number or
					string, or possibly the name of an object, event, or objective.
					<p>
					<B>Insert Operator</B> replaces this operator with a new one (such as
					<code>and</code>) and makes the current operator an argument of the
					new one.  For example, if you had this SEXP
					<br clear=all>
					<img src=nyarlathotep-before.gif vspace=10>
					<br clear=all>
					and then picked <b>Insert Operator</b> <code>and</code>, you'd get
					this one:
					<br clear=all>
					<img src=nyarlathotep-after.gif vspacee=10>
					<br clear=all>
					<b>Replace Operator</b> and <b>Replace Data</b> replace the current
					line (and any sub-SEXPs).
					<p>
					You can create variables to store information (numbers and text
					strings).  Use <b>Add Variable</b> to make a new one and set its
					default value.  Use <b>Modify Variable</b> to remove a variable or
					change its default value.  (If you want to change a variable's value
					during the course of a mission, use the <code>modify-variable</code>
					operator.)  <b>Replace Variable</b> replaces the current line of data
					with one of the variables you've defined.  <em>Variable names and string
					variable values cannot contain spaces.</em>
					<p>
					A few words about <code>incomplete</code> values are in order.  Some
					boolean SEXP operators 
					(such as <code>is-destroyed-delay</code>) can return the value
					<code>incomplete</code> instead of <code>true</code> or
					<code>false</code>.  This will change to <code>true</code> or
					<code>false</code> when appropriate.  (<code>is-destroyed-delay</code>
					becomes <code>true</code> when all of the specified ships are
					destroyed, <code>false</code> when at least one of them departs.)
					<p>
					There are three places where this can cause trouble:
					<ul>
					  <li>Anything which is <code>incomplete</code> at the end of a
					      mission becomes <code>false</code>.  Therefore, the operators
					      <code>is-goal-incomplete</code> and
					      <code>is-event-incomplete</code> should never be used in
					      debriefing or campaign branch SEXPs.
					  <li>Once an entire SEXP (for example, an event) returns something
					      other than <code>incomplete</code>, it will not be 
					      evaluated again.  (<a href=editors.html#events>Events</a> with a
					      <b>Repeat Count</b> of more
					      than 1 are an exception to this.)
					      <br clear=all>
					  <li>If the <code>not</code> operator is given
					      <code>incomplete</code> as an argument, it returns
					      <code>true</code>.
					      <p>
					      Specifically, consider this SEXP:
					      <br clear=all>
					      <img src=not-incomplete.gif vspace=10>
					      <br clear=all>
					      At the beginning of the mission, the
					      <code>is-destroyed-delay</code> sub-SEXP returns
					      <code>incomplete</code>.  Therefore, the <code>not</code>
					      returns <code>true</code>, and the event occurs immediately at the
					      beginning of the mission!
					      <br clear=all>

					  There are a lot of operators in FRED2.  Fortunately, the SEXP help
					  explains what each one does when you highlight it.
					  <p>
					  When you go to pick an operator in FRED2, many choices will be
					  grayed out.  This is usually because they don't return the right type of
					  information;  for example, the <code>time-docked</code> operator
					  returns a number, so you can't use it as the first argument of a
					  <code>when</code>, which must be boolean.
					  <p>
					  In order to help you find the operator you want, the operators
					  within each category are listed below.  Most of them are
					  self-explanatory.  If you're not sure about how to use one,
					  create a SEXP using it, highlight it, and look at the SEXP help at
					  the bottom of the editor.

					  There is only one operator in this group, <code>when</code>.  It is
					    the top-level operator in most events ("When this happens, do
					    these things"), and returns a boolean value.
					  <h3>Debugging</h3>
					    This group also contains only one operator, <code>debug</code>.
					    You probably won't need this one.
					  <h3>AI Goals</h3>
					  These operators affect the behavior of computer-controlled ships.
					    They return ship goals, which can be only be used as the second
					    argument to the <code>add-goal</code> operator.  Some of these
					    goals cannot be given to certain types of ships;  for example,
					    capital ships cannot perform the <code>ai-guard</code> order.
					    <p>
					    The <code>ai-chase</code> goal is equivalent to "attack" for fighters
					    and bombers.  For larger ships, "chase" is a better word;  they
					    will try to stay near the specified ship, but they will still fire at the
					    most threatening target in the area.  If you need to choreograph
					    capital ship fire in more detail, consider the
					    <code>beam-fire</code> operator.

					    happened in a previous mission in a campaign.
