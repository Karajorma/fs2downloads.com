1.1 Guide Information
______________________

This is the text version of the the Freespace 2 HTML guide - also made by Tim Wuyts.  Please keep 
in mind that the HTML guide is the primary guide: all updates will first be made in the HTML guide, 
it has some pictures of the spacecraft and weapons and it does contain some extra information here 
and there.

The author is the webmaster of  The Cheat Empire (URL see top of document), where you can find the 
latest cheats & walkthroughs for PC Games. Including the latest version of this guide.

I wrote this guide because I like to help people. I don't pretend to know everything there is to 
know about the game and I'm certainly not the best pilot out there. I would like to label myself an 
"average" pilot, who has tons of single player experience, but with minor multiplayer experience. I 
also believe a guide is never complete, so you can always help me by sending tips to me (don't add 
them yourself).

1.3 Introduction
_________________

I've been playing space sims since I was a small boy. When I think about space sims, I think about 
the legendary series like Wing Commander (Including Privateer) and X-Wing. No space sim could rival 
these titles ... up till now.

Although the first Freespace couldn't appeal me, Freespace 2 turned out to be a magnificent piece 
of art. The story is dragging you to the finish line and has a lot of (unsuspected) plots. The 
sound creates just the right atmosphere: music, voices and effects are all high quality. But 
probably the most stunning feature are the graphics ... that is, if you have a "mean machine". I 
was able to run Freespace 2 at a very high detail level in 1024x768. Words cannot describe the 
magic Volition created.

On top of the superb single player campaign, you also have a lot of multiplayer options. Team vs. 
Team, Dogfight and co-operative. On top of that we have the squad wars, which sounds very 
attractive to me. I say sounds, since I have never tried the on-line multiplayer capabilities 
(yet). I hope to test them out at my friends house, who has cable connection with the internet.

3.   GENERAL TACTICS
=====================

3.1 Preparations
_________________

Before you start doing some fancy dogfighting, it's necessary to make the proper preparations. This 
includes ship, gun and missile selection. This seems obvious, but I know quite a lot of friends who 
make a selection based on the name of the ship/weapon or whether it looks cool or not.

It's important to know what kind of weapons work best in certain situations. The Prometheus S for 
example is an extraordinary weapon, but because of it's slow refire rate, I'm not able to use it 
properly. This makes the weapon useless for me, since I prefer guns with a high refire rate which 
may lack the punch of the bigger brother.

It's also important to pick a ship where you are comfortable with. The GVF Serapis is an excellent 
interceptor with high speeds, but it's light armor do not fit the profile of my 'ideal' ship. 
Although not an interceptor, I prefer to take a ship with less maneuverability and more armor like 
the myrmidon.

If you know what you are going into, try to pick your most favorable ships, guns and missiles for 
that situation! The default selection of the computer is not bad, but don't be afraid to change it.


3.2 Know the Controls
______________________

Also obvious and simple. Just keep in mind that you don't need to know every key to be a good 
pilot. I know the keys which allow me to play comfortably and relaxed, e.g.: I never use the M key 
(auto adjust speed to target). Why? Because I think it's annoying. I want to go full speed ahead 
and I'll adjust my speed with the A/Z temporary speed adjust keys.

When I see a friend goofing up because he can't find the gun/missile selection key while flying, I 
have an urge put my head in the toilet and flush. Things like that shouldn't happen, they can mean 
the difference between life and death.

Most of you will be flying this space sim with a joystick (you have to be nuts if you don't). Well, 
don't forget to adjust the sensitivity of the joystick to your liking. Maximum sensitivity is not 
always the best option, since it has a big influence on your aim. To those who want to use the 
rudder but can't: you can install the rudder in your key assignment screen. Select absolute 
positioning if you install your rudder.


3.3 Flying
___________

There are lots of different flying styles, but I'm going to explain mine. This might help newbies a 
bit in developing their own style.

First of all adjust your weapon settings. I always tend to set my guns in dual fire mode (this 
already explains why I can't use 2 guns which drain power very fast). This gives me max. damage 
with the least effort. Once my gun energy is running low I switch back to single fire mode (but 
that almost never happens). For the missiles it depends on the type of missile and the type of 
target. Against fighters I use single/dual launch mode, depending on the rocket. Trebuchets 
shouldn't be launched to a fighter in dual launch mode ... it has sufficient power to knock a 
fighter down by itself. Dumbfires, on the other hand, are always launched in dual fire mode ... 
they lack punch against both fighters as capital ships. Against capital ships I always fire 
missiles in dual mode. There are only 2 exceptions: the Cyclops and the helios missile.

An important aspect of flying is being capable of dodging incoming fire (guns or missiles). Gunfire 
can easily be evaded by a simple maneuver. However, if the attacker is flying on your tail, you'll 
need to shake some fancy flying out of your sleeve in order to dodge the incoming fire. The best 
thing to do in such a situation is to stop focusing on your current target and trying to evade the 
hostile fighter completely, preferably in a position which allows you to take him out!
Evading missiles might seem easy ... you have the countermeasures for something right?! Wrong! In 
single player missions, you usually have enough countermeasures to finish a mission, but in the few 
multiplayer missions I have flown, you'll notice that they are depleted pretty fast. You need to 
learn how to evade missiles without countermeasures. If you are flying a fast agile fighter you 
have 2 possibilities. If you are flying a bomber, only 1. The first possibility for the fighter is 
to let the missiles get real close to you (mind the beeping noise). Once the missile is extremely 
close, you have to pull up (or any other direction) fiercely, in combination with a speed boost 
with the afterburners. This can't be applied by bombers, since they lack maneuverability and the 
speed to evade the missile. The second possibility works for both the fighter and the bomber. You 
should fly head on with the missile and just before impact you should pull up (or down). The 
missile will fly right past you ... This can be used bythe bombers too, since the missile has less 
time to correct it's path once the evasive maneuver starts. The second way of evading missiles is 
more efficient (if you follow the same path as the missile, it has more time to adjust it's flying 
path), but also harder (since the missile is closing in on you at a very high speed (missile speed 
+ your own velocity). Nonetheless, both methods require extensive training, since timing is an 
extremely important factor.

The easiest way to take out a target it to fly behind it and follow it, preferably from close 
range. Head-to-head situations are not healthy for your own fighter, so don't do it too often. 
Attacking a fighter from the side is also a possibility. This means that the target is no threat to 
you, but the target is much harder to hit, since small changes in speed result in a miss (this 
isn't the case when you tail your target). Also, don't be afraid to use your missiles ... if the 
banks get depleted, so what?! You can rearm yourself in most missions and by not using missiles 
you're making everything more difficult for yourself. This often results in finished missions with 
almost all missiles in the banks, that's not why they are there! Furthermore you should make a 
difference between the ships you are attacking:


Bombers
-------

Bombers aren't a real threat to a fighter, unless you are heavily outnumbered (this means that you 
get a rocket behind your tail every 5 seconds). Bombers lack maneuverability, which usually make 
them easy targets for your guns. If the need is high, you should fire missiles to speed up the job, 
otherwise your guns will be sufficient.

Remember however that taking a bomber out with your guns might take a while, because of their heavy 
hull and shielding. Therefore it's not wise (certainly in multiplayer) to hover behind a bomber for 
a longer period of time. This makes you the sitting duck, since your fighter isn't heavily armored 
and you are flying at slower speeds.


Fighters
--------

Fighters can be annoying from time to time. With their excellent maneuverability and often high 
speeds, they tend to be a more difficult target. I thought the SF Dragon was the hardest target to 
destroy: it outmaneuvered and outran you easily, but once you were able to hit it a few times they 
were spacedust. This is also the biggest drawback of the fighter, lack of shielding and hull 
plating. It doesn't take much to take out an enemy fighter (there are some exceptions like the SF 
Mara), but also remember that you are flying a similar craft and also are lightly armored. That's 
why I like the GTF Erinyes most. It has good speed, maneuverability and plating, combined with a 
large number of gun mounts and missile banks.


Warships
--------

It's not recommended to attack warships with a regular fighter. It's not fit for the job and 
usually does minor damage because of it's unadapted payload. If you want to take out multiple 
capital ships, make sure you pick a bomber.

While attacking a warship, always try to hit one of it's weapons or subsystems. This does damage 
and if you destroy a laser turret, that's one less thing to worry about. What should you target 
first? This depends on the urgency of the matter. If you notice one of your capital ships is being 
torn apart, head for the beam turrets. Otherwise I recommend to take out laser turrets or missile 
launchers first. You might also target one of the subsystems: engines if you don't want the target 
to get in close range of a certain ship, sensors or weapons - can't remember exactly - if you want 
to make the targeting system less accurate.


3.4 Favorite Ship
__________________

SHIP: GTF Erinyes

GUNS: GTW Subach HL-7
      GTW UD-8 Kayser 

MISSILES: GTM-19 Harpoon (2x) 


Why is this my favorite ship and weapon loadout? Simple, the Erinyes is an excellent ship: it's 
sturdy, has an average flying speed and average maneuverability. Combine this with the high number 
of gun mounts and 2 missile banks and you have the perfect dogfighter. Some will say, what's the 
difference with the Myrmidon ... I don't know! I tend to perform better with the Erinyes than with 
any other ship.

Why do you put a Subach HL-7 gun on the ship? There's this thing called energy management ... I 
don't like to toy around with the engine/shield/gun recharge levels and this solves my problem. If 
you want to pack a good punch, dual fire mode gives you the solution. I tend to fly with only the 
Kayser on-line ... once my energy levels become critically low, I switch to the Subach. This allows 
me to continue firing at the enemy, while the energy level has the opportunity to recharge (the 
Subach hardly drains any power).

The Harpoons are also an obvious choice, since this is my favorite dogfighting ship. No need for 
heavy trebuchets, cyclops or helios missiles. If you are fighting against the odds, speed is of the 
essence. The harpoon with his fast lock gives me the speed. Cripple the shields with the guns, fire 
the harpoon for the kill. The great thing of it is ... it works!

=======================================
4.   MISSION OVERVIEW  (Single Player)
=======================================

4.1 Information
________________

This is merely an overview of the single player missions, since I haven't played much multiplayer 
missions yet. Single player missions are also easier to write about, since you have total control 
over the success/failure of a mission.

I divided the missions just by numbers, not by category (SOC, Vasudan, Terran, ...). I suggest you 
read the general tactics section before going over the different missions. I was able to complete 
these missions with the tactics explained there!

The first missions are all very easy, but from level 20 and higher, you can notice a gradual climb 
in difficulty (some missions are more difficult than others). Strangely enough, the first missions 
weren't a high success (statistical wise - I didn't have a lot of kills), while in the latter 
missions I tend to be flying through enemy debris. Maybe it took some time to get used to the 
controls, or maybe I just had to get into berserk mode ... I don't know. When I replayed the 
missions, I did get a lot of extra kills.

This mission overview includes all training and SOC missions. If you decide to skip one of them, 
you should recalculate the missions numbers.

The missions themselves contain the following information:
    * Primary objectives 
    * Secondary objectives 
    * Default ship and loadout 
    * Possible ships and loadouts 
    * Overview of the mission 

Keep in mind that the primary and secondary objectives given in the mission overview are the ones 
at the beginning of the the mission. During the mission, extra objectives may be added. You can 
view them by pressing the F4 key!

If some of the information mentioned here is incorrect or incomplete, please contact me. I'm only 
human and bound to make a mistake here or there!

Escorting IOTA isn't that hard. The only opposition you'll get in this mission are some GTF 
Hercules (usually in pairs). Once all fighters have been taken out a friendly warship will arrive 
... a few moments later the NTF Corvette Belarius. You can engage it, but it'll get blown away by 
the friendly warship, so why bother.


4.6 Mission 5 - The Place of Chariots
______________________________________

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Sentries 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Aries 
* Investigate Asteroid 
* Destroy Installation 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Virgo

You'll be dealing with a few GTF Hercules' here, but you'll encounter more GTF Loki's.

Once you start the mission, take out the fighters first, followed by the sentry guns. Once that's 
done, wait for more fighters to jump into your system.

After a while command will give you the order to investigate the asteroid (blinking red dot on 
radar). Do it and take out the turrets as you move closer to the asteroid. Once it has been ID'ed, 
you should destroy it. The ICENI goes into hyperjump though, and you won't be able to destroy it in 
time. While attacking the asteroid/installation/ICENI, some new fighters will appear. Take them out 
as you see fit (cfr. if they annoy you).


4.7 Mission 6 - The Romans Blunder
___________________________________

Objectives
----------

Primary objectives:    Destroy the NTF ICENI
                       Extra: Destroy freighters
Secondary Objectives:  Extra: Destroy NTF Fighters

Ship and loadout
----------------

Default:

   Ship:      GTF Myrmidon	
   Guns:      GTW Subach HL-7 (2x)	
   Missiles:  GTM MX-64 Rockeye (2x)
              GTM MX-6 Tempest Missile	

Possibilities:

   Ships:     None	
   Guns:      None	
   Missiles:  None	

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy the ICENI 
* Destroy Freighters 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Scorpio 

You'll never reach the ICENI in time, so don't bother. You'll be reassigned to stop any enemy ship 
that comes through the system.

First 2 freighters will enter the system, together with a fighter escort. Needless to say, take out 
the fighters (GTF Loki I believe) first followed by the freighters (which are an easy target).

Once this job is done a few warships jump in ... also with a fighter escort. Concentrate on the 
fighters first, once they are blown out of the sky, concentrate on the warships. They should have 
sustained quite a bit of damage by now (because of the Psamtik), so finishing them off should be 
easy by now. 


4.8 Mission 7 - Training 4
___________________________

Objectives
----------

Primary objectives:    None

* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy MAUL 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy NEQAEL 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy GOLIATH 
* Destroy Libra

There's a lot to be done in this mission. Quite a lot of Shivan fighters and smaller warships have 
to be destroyed. Basically you have to take it as it comes. Take out the fighters first, but if you 
notice that a fighter is a few 1000m away and you're flying past a warship, try to take out the 
warship first.

Since the warships aren't that big, your hornets (if these are the missiles you picked) do quite a 
bit of damage (dual fire mode = 8 missiles). Combined with a good old fashioned energy weapon, it 
will be creamed in no time.

You'll meet 2 Shivan fighters: SF Mara and SF Astaroth. The Mara has good plating and speed but 
only a reasonable maneuverability. It's also quite big and therefore easy to hit. The Astaroth is 
more maneuverable and also has a higher speed, but it's fragile. You might miss it a few times, but 
once you hit it ... it'll be out of the sky in no time.

* Follow Zeta 1 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Aries 
* Protect DISCOVERY 
* Destroy TRINITY 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Libra

At first everything is very quiet in this mission. All you have to do is follow Zeta 1 until you 
notice some enemies on your radar. Once that happens, move in to destroy them. You'll encounter 
some SF Manticores. A little bit later, you'll notice another wing of Manticores. Once they are 
taken out, continue your patrol.

You'll encounter the NTF Trinity, protect it and the repair team they send to recover it. Once the 
repair team has jumped in, more Shivan fighters will appear, including: SF Manticores, SF Basilisks 
and SF Dragons. Fight them off at your best ability, but once the Dragons jump in, the mission is 
over. The Trinity and the Discovery will be destroyed (they went from 96% health to 0% in a matter 
of seconds ... don't ask me how). GTVA command will announce that you have to return to base. Do 
so, or you'll have to deal with 2 wings of enemy Dragons and that usually isn't too healthy.

* Protect Corvettes 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy ASURAS 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy IBLIS 
* Destroy Cancer

Since protecting the Corvette is you primary objective, always make sure that you return to it once 
you've taken out the fighters. That way you are always on time to intercept the next wing of enemy 
fighters.

First you'll get a wing of Astaroths and Maras to hold off. This shouldn't be too hard.

The next time the Asuras an 2 fighter escorts will jump in. First take out the fighters (Astaroths 
and Basilisks), since they pose the biggest threat to you (although I wouldn't call a Basilisk a 
big threat). The Asuras isn't a big to the Corvettes in the beginning (unless it takes you 1 hour 
to take out the fighters). Once the fighters are goners, fire some hornets at the Asuras, taking it 
down shouldn't take too long.

The next wings contain of Maras and SB Seraphims, needless to say that the Seraphims, should be 
engaged first. They are extremely dangerous for the Corvettes, so try to take them out before they 
can launch their bombs. Proceed with the Maras.

Now the Iblis will jump in, together with a Mara wing. Same procedure as with the Asuras.

Suddenly an unknown ship will appear on radar. Upon investigation you come to the conclusion that 
it's a destroyer and it will cream the Corvettes no matter what you do. Jump out of the system, 
once you are told to do so. 


4.13 Mission 12 - Slaying Ravana

   Guns:      GTW Subach HL-7
              GTW Akheton SDG	
   Missiles:  GTM MX-6 Tempest Missile	

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy RAVANA 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Saggitarius 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Leo

I didn't fly this mission with the Boanerges, but with the Medusa. Mainly because of the 
maneuverability (the boanerges can't even follow a ship if it flew past him at 1 mps - making it a 
terrible ship for dogfights).

Although your job is to take out the Ravana, don't forget about the fighters either. If you let 
them alive too long, all of your wingmates will be dead and they will all come after you - so this 
is a definite no, no. Before heading for the Ravana take out the Basilisks (they are closer than 
the Ravana).

Now head for the Ravana and launch your Cyclops missiles at close range (eg. 0.5 km - it takes a 
while to acquire a lock. If you launch from too far, the Cyclops can be destroyed before impact. If 
you launch too close, you'll get hit by the blast radius.) I tend to target the sensors or weapons 
systems, first (whatever the bombs can hit from my current fly path).

Once the cyclops' have been launched (dual fire mode) occupy yourself with the fighters again. It's 
wise to engage the fighters away from the Ravana (if it starts shooting it's flak guns, your 
shields and hull might get creamed), but this isn't always possible. If you retreat to engage the 
fighters, head for the Kehnmu (Corvette), since it'll help to destroy the fighters.  This is also a 
good place to rearm yourself, because of the protection the Corvette gives. Once you've taken out 
the fighters that were bugging you, head back for the Ravana. This will avoid getting a bunch of 
fighters behind your tail while paying enough attention to crippling the Ravana.

Repeat until the mission is finished.

PS. If you want to fire the Cyclops 2x you have to keep in mind that it needs a reload time of 20 
seconds. If you have 2 banks with Cyclops missiles, just change the bank you are firing from to 
speed things up.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Protect Transports 
* Destroy CATO 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy HAWKWOOD 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Taurus

First take out the GTF Hercules', followed by the Cato. Once the bombers jump (GTB Zeus) in 
redirect yourself to these and let the Cato alone for a while. Since you have to protect the 
station, you have to act swiftly. Intercept the bombers as fast as you can, if they are able to 
launch missiles take them out first and afterwards the bombers. Once the first wing of bombers is 
destroyed, go back and finish off the Cato.

By that time a second wing of bombers will fly in, followed shortly by the Hawkwood. Concentrate on 
the bombers (and bombs) for now, only if there are no more bombers left, go back to take on the 
Hawkwood. Don't just fire to do damage, try to destroy weaponry or subsystems. The same rule 
applies here, once more bombers fly in, divert your attention. Eventually the GTVA Colossus will 
jump in to finish the Hawkwood (that's why it's important to take on it's weapons and subsystems - 
so it can only do minimal damage to the station/transports - the Colossus will destroy it for you)

Mission Overview
----------------

* Defend Convoy 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Capricorn 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy MAELSTROM

Head for the flashing red dots in the radar and take out a few sentry guns. Don't keep on 
destroying sentry guns, since there are bombers flying towards the convoy. It's more important to 
intercept them. Once the bombers (and bombs) are destroyed, take on the fighters and then 
concentrate your fire on the remaining sentry guns.

Nothing will happen for quite a long time now. Suddenly some fighters and the Maelstrom will jump 
in ... first try to take out the beam weapon of the Maelstrom, it does a lot of damage to the 
convoy if you don't take it out. This is one of the crucial factors to complete the primary 
objective. Once that's done, kill the fighters (if any are left) and make scrap out of the 
Maelstrom (with the help of the Deimos and the remaining fighters).

You'll be confronted with a few Hercs and 2 GTC's (Majestic and Refute). These can be destroyed 
quite easily. Afterwards, multiple GTF Loki's will jump in. They are fast and agile, but can't take 
a beating. Just concentrate on all new fighter wings that jump in.

If the destroyer jumps it, leave it be. The Colossus will jump in to help you, but they will 
collide with each other. You can't stop it, so why bother attacking the GTD (unless you want to 
improve your stats)

Mission Overview
----------------

* Scan Iceni 
* Destroy YAARU 
* Protect ICENI 
* Protect HINTON 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Sagittarius

This is definitely the most difficult mission up till now. First go and scan the Iceni (600m) and 
then go and scan the Hinton (200m - bonus objective). Now some bombers and fighters will enter the 
system. Forget about the fighters, head straight for the bombers and deal with them swiftly. Speed 
of execution is very important ... a little screw up here or there usually results in failure.

Like I already said, bombers are a priority, no matter which wings jump in. Let the Taurets toy a 
bit and destroy them once you have the time. There will also be 2 warships: a GVC and a GVCv. The 
first is pretty easy to destroy, the second is a nightmare (esp. to the Iceni). Once it flies in, 
try to destroy all the beam turrets first. Another good tactic is to take out the weapon system. At 
approximately the same time, you'll get orders to intercept any incoming asteroids, do this once 
the turrets or weapon system have been taken out. The asteroids have a higher priority than 
fighters which might harass you. If a lot of them impact the Iceni, it's history too. Only engage 
fighters if you have a short break!

If you want to know the damage the asteroids do in combination with the GVCv, I suggest you stand 
down and watch the Iceni health indicator diminish rapidly.

* Protect HAMAKO 
* Destroy Kappa 
* Destroy Iota 
* Destroy MYLAE 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy HELLESPONT 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Aquarius

Suddenly, the rest of the fighter escort discovers that you are a traitor. Take them out with the 
help of the lieutenant. They are all Hercs Mark II, but they are pretty easy to defeat. Tempest 
dumbfire missiles help you to take out targets fast, since they don't require a lock. So use them!  
If you have trouble in the higher difficulty settings (eg. hard) pump your shields up to the max, 
minus 2 for the engine (no gun power, you can deplete your current gun energy though).

Then additional NTF Fighters will jump in, but they won't attack you. Once the GTVA Fighters jump 
in, the NTF's will become hostile. So kill them too. After you destroyed all enemy fighters, assign 
a wing of the skull squadron to protect the Hamako and let the other wing protect the Sunder. This 
will will help a lot later in the mission.

A little while later the Mylae will jump in with a Herc Fighter escort. First take out the 
fighters, the Mylae doesn't do a lot of damage. The Hercs shouldn't take too long with the help of 
the other GTVA fighters. Then take out the Mylae ... also pretty easy.

Then the Hellespont will jump in, together with a fighter escort which consists of Hercs and Hercs 
Mark II. I suggest you leave the Hercs alone for the moment and concentrate on the Hellespont, it 
does a lot of damage to the Sunder if you intercept it too late. Prioritize the beam turrets, once 
they are take care of ... go for the kill. A friendly Corvette will jump in to assist you. If there 
are any fighters left after the destruction of the Hellespont, engage them too.

Once all friendly ships have jumped out of the area, wait for the NTC rendezvous ships and then 
return to base.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy Alastor 
* Destroy Beta 
* Destroy Alpha 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy SAHARAN

In this mission they know you are a traitor so I suggest the following: Stay low in the beginning 
of this mission, don't engage any sentry guns. The idea is this: the less you damage the sentry 
guns, the more they can damage the NTF fighters. This means that later on in the mission, you don't 
have to hit them as much to destroy them.

Once the NTF fighters have taken out the sentry guns and the cargo, a transport (Elysium) will jump 
in. Don't engage it! After a few warnings the NTF Fighters will turn hostile. This is the a 
difficult part of this mission. Take out the Myrmidons as soon as possible (a good way to take out 
the first ship very fast is by flying right behind it, once it turns hostile all you have to do is 
press the fire button and BOOM, it's out of there) ... don't be afraid to use missiles to take out 
the first targets in a few seconds. Otherwise you'll get a bunch of fighters behind you and that's 
not recommendable. If your shield is crippled by the fight, wait a while before you kill the last 
fighter. No new ships will jump in unless this wing has been completely destroyed. Once you're back 
to full strength, destroy the last ship.

Once they are taken care of, a little while later, more Myrmidons will appear. The key is to do 
evasive maneuvers once they jump in! It's not very healthy to engage them right away, you are way 
outnumbered here. Luckily, additional fighter wings will jump in to help you. Once they do, you can 
engage the enemy too, since they aren't able to concentrate their fire only on you. It doesn't 
really matter if you first take care of the fighters or the cruiser, as long as they die somewhere 
along the way, you're OK. Once they all are destroyed, return to the GTVA base ... Your undercover 
SOC missions are over.

----------------

* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy MALOR 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Virgo

Wait until the ships you need to escort to jump in. Once they do, just wait for the first enemy 
wing to jump in. Once they do, take them (SF Manticores) out. Later on, you'll get some Maras on 
your back, but they shouldn't pose a problem either.

Once the cruiser jumps in, call in Zeta wing. They are more fit to take out cruisers, I wouldn't 
worry to much about the cruiser if you called in Zeta. They can take care of it pretty fast. You 
keep your eye on new incoming wings of fighters and bombers. Once the bombers (SB Nephelims) 
arrive, make sure you take them out first. The freighters and the Lucidity have a real 
lowthresholdd for damage so ...

Overall, this mission was pretty easy to complete. There are lots of dead moments in between the 
different wings, giving you plenty of time to recover.

* TAG Cancer 
* TAG Scorpio 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Libra

At first you'll encounter some Basilisks. You can either tag them or destroy them, it doesn't 
really matter, as long as they get destroyed. But, as expected, something goes wrong: an 
(unexpected) wing of Shivan fighters jump in ... including bombers!

Once this happens, TAG as many different targets as possible ... once this is done, you can easily 
finish them off with your guns. Remember that the TAG-A is a dumbfire missile, so try to get in 
close before you fire it. You'll notice that your target is tagged by the yellow (instead of red) 
brackets around them. The tag will wear off after a few seconds. Also keep in mind that the target 
should be within 3000m of the capital ship ... otherwise it's useless. Make sure you keep your 
distance once you tagged a target, it's not healthy to be caught in the beam that was meant to 
damage the enemy fighter.

Just make sure you intercept the bombers in time. Once they are gone, you'll surely be able to 
finish the mission without any further complications.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Protect OBERON 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Protect AQUITAINE 
* Destroy TIAMAT 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Libra

You'll have to test the stealth abilities of the Pegasus (unfortunately, you are not allowed to fly 
it in this mission). They call in the Oberon, an old cruise, which you have to defend. You'll 
notice that it's pretty hard to fly without a lock on your target. But once you have visual 
contact, you won't lose track of the Pegasus easily. I think you have to keep the Oberon for at 
least 20% healthy in order to protect it successfully. I really don't see the point of this, 
because you can fire as much as you want (and hit the target of course), the Pegasus will continue 
it's standard attack/retreat routines. It doesn't matter one bit if you hit it or miss it. The only 
way to break their attack is by firing the morning star on them ... but you can only occupy 
yourself with one target and it doesn't take a long time to recover from the kinetic effect.  
Anyway, just don't waste your missiles on them!

Once the second part of the test is about to begin, a group of Shivan fighters (Mara) will jump in 
... time for some real action. A bit later the Taurus group will jump in. These are bombers, so 
intercept them and their bombs first! They pose a serious threat to the Aquitaine. By the time you 
have taken them out a corvette will jump in (Tiamat) ... destroy it first! Target the beam turrets, 
so it doesn't inflict much damage to the Aquitaine. Then go for whichever weapon system you want 
... I usually go for the flaks or missile launchers first, but tend to pick off a laser here and 
there as the opportunity arises. Remember that you have to keep close to the Tiamat in order to get 
help from the Aquitaine. Your sensors allow the Aquitaine to open fire. Once the Tiamat is 
destroyed (or jumped out) take care off the remaining fighters.

Mission Overview

* Destroy UHURU 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy PAX 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy LIBERTY 
* Destroy UNDAUNTED 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy INSPIRATION 
* Destroy PERSEVERANCE

Since you are flying a bomber and your primary mission is to take out warships. However, you should 
not neglect the fighter wings. There are 4 sentry guns (GTSG Mjolnir) who have beam turrets. They 
help a great deal with the destruction of the warships. All fighters launched want to take out 
these sentry guns ... so deal with them.

For the first warships, I wouldn't use too many cyclops'. Your wingmates fire enough missiles to 
destroy the target for you. Remember that if you engage the first warships, you'll probably need to 
rearm, to take out targets that arrive later. Rearming is always a risky business! While your 
wingmates take out the first capital ship you can spent some engaging the enemy fighters!

Once the Liberty and the Undaunted jumped in, I started to engage warships too. Your wingmates seem 
to have depleted their cyclops' missiles by that time. Also communicate with your wings to optimize 
destruction. Let another wing engage a target, you are not engaging. The Perseverance (the last 
warship to jump in) is also the most difficult to destroy ... if you have to rearm yourself at the 
time it jumps in, you can forget about it. You have such a short time span and practically no help 
from your wingmates. It's not a disaster if it jumps out of the system (happened to me too a few 
times), but it's more satisfying to see it explode into a thousand pieces.

* Destroy VINDICATOR

* Destroy Pisces

Once you jump in the Vindicator and the Venture are already in the system, no Iceni though. Once 
you launched your cyclops (2x) divert your attention to the Hercules fighters. It takes 20 seconds 
before you can fire another missile. The Hercules fighters shouldn't be hard to destroy, once they 
have been destroyed you should concentrate on destroying the warship and the transport (don't use 
cyclops' on the transport, it's not worth it).

From now on, keep on concentrating on taking out bigger ships. There's a wing of Myrmidons to 
assist you with the destruction of the fighters. You might want to rearm, but like I said before, 
watch out ... you're a sitting duck if any enemy wing is in the vicinity.

The beginning of this mission is quite hectic, but things will slow down eventually. The first part 
is also the most important part. Protect the Monitor from the bombers and fighters. Taking the 
bombers out shouldn't take too long. Once you have successfully repelled the first wave, the 
Colossus will jump in to relieve the Monitor of duty.

From then on, do the thing you are supposed to do: take out all hostiles. The Colossus will help 
taking out the bigger ships, so don't worry too much about those.

Once the Iceni jumps in the Colossus malfunctions (figures!). Don't try to take it out, you won't 
get the time. Keep concentrated on the fighters.

* Destroy Gas Miners 
* Destroy Sentries 
* Destroy Virgo

You have to find a good balance between picking off fighters/sentries and destroying miners. If 
you're having troubles, you're probably concentrating too much of your fire on the miners, which do 
minimal damage to your fighter. The only thing you should keep in mind when you are flying this 
mission is: don't fly too close to the miners when they explode. Your hull will be crippled 
severely if a miner explodes in your vicinity.

Once all miners, sentries, fighters, ... have been taken out, the Shivans will launch an attack on 
the Tatenen. Target the bombers first, then take care of the remaining fighters. Once that's done, 
you have to investigate an unknown ship. Once you discover what it is (a juggernaut class warship - 
let's just call it a big warship), it's already too late. The Tatenen will be blown away.

* Scan Communications
* Scan Weapons
* Scan Sensors
* Scan Navigation 

This is an easy mission. Target the different subsystems and do a scan (a few seconds from close 
range). Make sure you target the subsystem closest to you, this reduces the flight time. You might 
get some missiles fired at you, but they shouldn't be that hard to dodge.

Once the systems are all scanned you get 2 option: return to base or take out as many turrets as 
you can. Just take out the turrets, they are easy to destroy and there's little opposition. Do this 
until the Sathanas jumps out of the system.

* Destroy Virgo

* Destroy Scorpio

This is a strange mission: you have to destroy all warships, but they are never mentioned in your 
objectives screen in the HUD. If you are flying the Serapis, I wouldn't engage too many warships, 
just occupy yourself with the fighters. Delta wing (needs to be called in) in combination with the 
friendly capital ships are more than enough to take out warships.

Later in the mission you'll be confronted with the supreme Shivan fighter (in my opinion) the SF 
Dragon. They are agile, fast and can do a lot of damage ... luckily they have a light hull. But in 
overall, this mission should be nothing to worry about!

Mission Overview
----------------

* Engage Hostiles 
* Lure Shivans to RENENET 
* Destroy Capricorn 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Pisces

In the beginning some astaroth's are patrolling the Knossos device. Just engage them, more will 
jump in while you are fighting. You could lure them closer to the Renenet, this makes things easier 
for you. It's also mentioned in the objectives screen in your HUD, because it keeps the Shivans 
away from the meson bomb.

The main advantage of fighting close to the Renenet is that you don't have to fly away from the 
meson bomb to clear the area. They just begin countdown and they don't bug you that much. At the 
time the countdown begins, some SF Dragons will jump in. Just let them be, they will all be wiped 
away by the meson bomb.

Once the first bomb exploded (but wasn't successful) a wing of SF Mara's will jump in. In other 
words: nothing to worry about if you are fast enough. If you tend to get swamped by the Mara's, 
fight closer to the Renenet, so it can help you. Once they have been wiped out, a second and third 
meson bomb will be deployed. Just wait until lambda jumps out and the bomb will explode. But 
suddenly the Sathanas jumps in without the use of the Knossos device (surprise, surprise!). It's 
time to head back to base.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy Forward Flak Guns 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Beam Turrets 
* Destroy Beam Turrets 
* Destroy Gemini

This is a not so difficult mission if you know how to fly it ... I have been successful in taking 
out all beam turrets and the flak guns, but that means that you have to fly a perfect mission (cfr. 
if the 2 helios missiles fail to take out a beam turret completely, your chances of taking out all 
4 are greatly diminished). The success of the mission depends on the way you deploy the helios 
missiles. You should launch them from close range and at maximum speed (with afterburners). If you 
do this correctly, launching 2 helios missiles (dual fire mode) will be enough to take down one 
beam turret.

The next question a lot of players might ask ... I only have 4 helios missiles. How am I supposed 
to take out more than 2 beam turrets? Easy, rearm yourself. Call for the rearming ship once you 
start the mission. You can rearm yourself while the new helios missiles are loaded into your 
missile banks (30 seconds) ... this is also a perfect time to start taking out the flak guns. You 
can easily rearm and shoot at the flak guns at the same time! Another option is to let your escort 
wings attack the flak guns, they can take it out in no time!

Also keep in mind that you can call in reinforcements at any time ... they can help a great deal 
keeping the enemy fighters at a distance.

Once this is done, do it again ... and again (you don't need to rearm every time).

Once the Sathanas jumps out, don't head back to base. You have to take out another ship (you can 
rearm while you are waiting, the helios missiles will make things just a bit easier). You have to 
take out the Beleth's beam turrets. First target the engines to stop the warship (unless you can do 
it in time). Then start taking out the beam turrets and then finish it off. It's not advisable to 
destroy it immediately (before you take out the turrets), since the objectives for taking out the 
beam turrets will be incomplete (It's strange, I know - I've notified Volition about this).

Now it's time to destroy Gemini wing and head out of there!

The number of beams you have to destroy in this mission, depends on how many beams you destroyed in 
the previous. If you did a bad job, you'll have to sweat it out in this mission. If you want to 
know how to take out the beams, check the previous mission.

Once the beams are taken out, concentrate on taking out Cancer wing. This shouldn't be very hard. 
Once the fighters are taken out, take out the remaining weapons on the Sathanas: beam turrets, flak 
guns, laser guns, missile launchers ...  Once the Sathanas is about to explode, move closer to the 
Colossus (or just make sure there's a save distance between you and the Sathanas).  You don't want 
to get caught in the blast radius.   Once the Sathanas is destroyed, jump back to base.

First take out the SF Mara's that are in the system, then head for one of the cruisers and take it 
out with the help of beta wing. By the time it's destroyed, a wing of bombers will have jumped in. 
You intercept the bombers and their bombs, while you can let Beta wing take care of the remaining 
cruiser.

Once the transport jumps in, different wings of enemy fighters and bombers will jump in. Just 
remember that bombers are always a priority! No transport/Iceni, means a failed mission objective 
and the bombers are the only threat. Just watch your radar closely and once you see a new wave of 
fighters jumping in, head to intercept. If you take most of them out before they become a threat 
you should have no trouble completing this mission.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy DAHAKA 
* Destroy SEPHIROTH 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Capricorn 
* Destroy Taurus

This mission has nothing to do with the recovery of the Azrael. During the mission you'll be given 
a complete set of new instructions, so listen carefully (or watch them in the F4 objectives 
screen).

Fly toward the red blinking dots in your radar. You'll find a second subspace portal. You'll be 
engaging a dogfight with multiple SF Dragons and a few Mara's. Like I already said, they are hard 
to destroy because of their speed and maneuverability. Don't call in the reinforcements, since this 
triggers the arrival of a cruiser ... and that's one more thing to worry about. First take out all 
dragons and the Dahaka, then call in Delta wing. It'll be easy to take out the Sephiroth.

The Psamtik will jump in (about 9000m away from the device), assign your wings to defend it. There 
will be a few wings, but they are not so hard to destroy. Once this is done a new Juggernaut will 
jump in and destroy the Psamtik. You'll get the order to return to base.

* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Pisces 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy Capricorn 
* Destroy Sagittarius 
* Destroy Aquarius

First intercept the Mara's attacking the Aquitaine - you should have some time left to help the 
Aquitaine with the Abaddon if you're fast enough. However, once the fighters jump in, concentrate 
on them. The Aquitane can take care of the Abaddon itself.

Some bombers and Mara's will jump in by the time you have taken out the Astaroth's. First take out 
the bombers (and their bombs), since they can do the most damage to the Aquitaine, then go for the 
fighters. Some additional Basilisks and SB Taurvi will jump in. Again, you should first concentrate 
on the bombers, then on the fighters!

Now you'll have to wait a while until the transport has docked with the Aquitaine. Once this 
operation is complete more bombers (and only bombers from now on) will jump in. SB Taurvi's, but 
mostly SB Nahema's ... hold them off until the Aquitaine has jumped.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Follow Nav Buoys 
* Find GRALL 
* Call in LAMBDA 1 
* Protect LAMBDA 1

This SOC mission is not so difficult, but it can get quite annoying. Your HUD doesn't function 
properly because of the interference caused by the nebula. The trick is to keep an eye on your 
radar. It may not function properly, but in between the glitches you can use it to navigate through 
the nebula. Just fly to the next nav buoy and once you fly past it, a new buoy (grey dot) will 
appear on radar. So all you have to do, is watch where the new dot appears on the radar and fly 
towards it.

There will be a wing (or two) of Basilisks around each buoy, but they are easy to destroy. The 
hardest part is to get back on track after the engagement (I once flew all the way back to NB 1 - 
Aaaaaaaaargh!).

After 7 buoys you'll finally reach the Grall, but it's under attack by Nahema bombers. Needless to 
say that you have to take them out. Watch out though, they might send quite a few missiles behind 
your tail. Sometimes it's better to do evasive maneuvers than it is to stick to your target!

Once the bombers have been taken out, call in Lambda 1. Some enemy wings will jump in, but they 
shouldn't give you too much trouble.

Mission Overview
----------------

* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Shivan Devices 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy Aries

Once the mission starts, immediately dive with your fighter and hit the afterburners to evade the 
Juggernaut who goes into hyperspace.  Then start heading for the Shivan device.  Once you get to 
close, the Shivans will be alerted and engage you!

The most efficient way to take out the device is by destroying the subspace crystal in the center 
of the device (the red center).  You just need a couple of missiles (if you hit it correctly).  
Once you've destroyed it (the red center doesn't burst or anything), the device will self destruct.  
The best way to hit it is by flying close to the center, into the device ... between the rotating 
arms.  However, the explosion of the device is very powerful and it can do some serious damage to 
your hull.  So you have to get out of that position as fast as you can, once you destroyed it!  
Another way to go (and which is preferred) is to change your missiles before starting the mission.  
I tend to take harpoons and trebuchets with me.  The harpoons help me take out the enemy fighters 
while the trebuchets can be used to take out the crystals at a great distance.  This may take a few 
tries though, the rotating arms provide good cover for the crystal.

For the other 2 devices, you can always rely on your wingmates, should your hull be critically 
damaged.  You can hold off the Shivan fighters / bombers.  Taking out the devices is a priority 
though, the bombers and fighters will keep on jumping in.  Since the distance between the different 
devices is so big, it's wise to divert power to your engines ... so your afterburners can recharge 
faster, enabling you to reach the devices faster (this buys you some minutes).

Once the devices are destroyed, head back to the jump node and wait until 15:00 have passed (take 
out any hostiles that bother you).  Also watcht out for the warship that jumps in; if you wait 
inside the jump node, it's likely that you die because of a collisions once if jumps in.  Once the 
15 mins are over, your jump drives will be enabled and you can jump out of there!

* Destroy Leo 
* Protect Convoy 
* Destroy Gibborim Beams 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy Aries 
* Destroy Virgo

If you have troubles completing this mission successfully, don't be too shy to call in Theta wing. 
They don't solve a lot of problems, but they do take some of the pressure away. Personally, I found 
this mission pretty hard ... you can easily stay alive, but it's hard to keep whole convoy in one 
piece. You have to be extremely fast or you're bound to lose a few ships in the convoy.

Bombers and bombs should be intercepted immediately. If there are multiple bomber wings, assign 
Theta specifically to a certain wing. This allows you to occupy yourself with the the other wing, 
while Theta wing takes care of the other bombers.

Try to keep the Nebtuu alive as long as possible, it helps a great deal destroying the warship that 
was already in the system. Don't make the mistake of attacking the SC too fast! Don't head straight 
for it once it enters the system (I believe it's 6.5km away). First occupy yourself with the 
bombers and go after the SC Cain once it becomes a threat.

Assign Delta wing to defend Lambda wing 1 and 2 (once they are in the system). This should provide 
enough cover for the transports, while you have the time to engage enemies all over the playing 
field.

Again the same story while escorting capital ships ... concentrate on bombers and the bombs they 
launch. Fighters are of a lesser priority (but should also be taken out). If you abide this rule, 
you'll finish the mission in no time!

* Destroy Freighters 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy BAAL 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Libra

There don't seem to be that many fighters in this mission, so you shouldn't have any troubles 
taking them all out of commission. This means you also have plenty of time to attack some warships 
(make sure you adjust your missile loadout to deal with capital ships (dumbfires work just fine)). 
Don't get cocky though, once you notice that your hull integrity has dropped to a critical level, 
don't bother about the warships any more (if this happens it will be near the end of the mission)

Once the bomber squadron becomes available to you, let them take out all capital ships while you 
let one of the fighter wings protect it.

Whatever you do, the GTVA Colossus will always be destroyed. So don't bother about it!

Mission Overview
----------------

* Protect the BASTION 
* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Aquarius 
* Destroy Leo 
* Destroy Taurus 
* Destroy Virgo

Intercept all bombers and fighters ... but you should especially focus on the bombers and the 
missiles they fire. Make sure you are able to intercept them in time. Fighters tend to do some 
damage to capital ships, but they don't carry Cyclops missiles, ... When you are intercepting the 
bombs, make sure you don't destroy them from close range. An exploding Cyclops at close range can 
seriously damage your shields.

Trebuchets are a good choice for this mission, mainly because of their range and power. But don't 
load them in both your missile banks. You have to make sure that you have enough missiles (you 
can't carry 400 trebuchets) to last this mission and the next one (you don't get time to reload or 
choose another ship).

Once the Bastion is safe, you are treated with a little FMV.

* Destroy Sagittarius

* Destroy Cancer 
* Destroy Gemini 
* Destroy BANE 
* Destroy MELCHOM 
* Destroy Scorpio 
* Destroy Libra 
* Destroy Virgo 
* Destroy Leo

This mission is easy to say the least. If you wait for 12 minutes inside the jump node and then 
jump out of the system, the game is over.

However, it's more fun to do some dogfighting for 12 minutes, than just sitting there and wait. 
Take on every fighter wing that comes into the system, but keep a special eye out to the bombers 
and the heavy payload missiles they fire.

At first you'll encounter bombers - followed by a wing of Dragons - and again nothing but bombers.

Make sure that, when the 12 minute deadline is coming closer, prepare to head back for the jump 
node. If you don't make it on time, you'll be fried by the supernova (only a small difference in 
the ending movie). Once they announce the supernova you have 50 seconds to reach the node and jump 
out of there. The first time, I didn't expect the supernova, but was able to reach the node in time 
(I was 7500 m away from the node). Unfortunately I didn't have any time left to do the jump.

5.1 Information
________________

This gives you a nice overview of all the weapons you can use. There isn't any extensive 
information though, mainly because it's not available.

I've divided the weapons into guns and missiles. Just click any weapons to view some detailed 
specs. I've tried to verify the range of all weapons (which is not easy on flying targets in singe 
player). If I'm wrong, just mail me and I'll correct the error.  If someone has information about 
other weapon specs like damage, refire rate, ...  please contact me.

5.3 Missiles
_____________

With missiles you only have to check 2 things:

The type of missile (dumbfire, heat- or aspect-seeking) 
The kind of damage they inflict (area, EMP, ...). 

Also keep in mind that heavier missiles need longer reload times, are slow (and therefore should be 
dropped at max speed) and take a long time to lock on to a target.

6.1 Information
________________

This ship guide is far from complete, mainly because of the lack of info Volition provides. 
Therefore I have only selected ships that you'll be flying. This means that only fighter and bomber 
class ships have been mentioned ... no destroyers, cruisers, .... This also means that no Shivan 
fighters are mentioned (except for the modified Terran one). You'll encounter them in a few 
mission, but you never get the opportunity to fly it. I also haven't included the blablabla texts 
Volition has provided in the encyclopaedia.

You can find every ship listed per race and alphabetically. Just click the ship you want to watch 
and you'll get an overview of the ship, including a little snapshot of it.

There are abbreviations in front of the name of the ship, which contain some vital information. The 
abbreviation usually contains 2 components: a race component and a ship class component. If you 
combine both together you get the full abbreviation:
