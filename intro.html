      <h1>KARAJORMA'S FREESPACE FAQ</h1>



      
      <h2>VERSION 2.1</h2>



      
      <h2>What is covered in this FAQ??</h2>



      
      <p>The <a href="http://wiki.hard-light.net/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">FreeSpace
 Wiki</a>
is probably one of the best resources available to the community.
However due to it's structure some people have found it hard to use.
This FAQ is designed to contain much of the basic information in a
simpler and easier to use fashion. It's worth remembering however that
while the Wiki is maintained by whoever in the community wishes to
update it, this FAQ is maintained by just myself. As a result it can
date more quickly. For this reason the FAQ will in general avoid the
most up to date solutions and problems as those are the ones that
change the most quickly and then make the FAQ look inaccurate. <br>



      </p>

      
      <p>This FAQ is not designed as a replacement for the <a 
href="http://wiki.hard-light.net/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.
Instead it's designed as an index and guide to it. Many entries in the
FAQ will have a link to the Wiki so that you can check there for
further information or an alternative way of doing things.<br>



      </p>

      
      <p>In addition to indexing the wiki the FAQ can carry guides to
things like the HotU version etc that HLP have previously had to
distance themselves from somewhat. Lastly unlike the wiki the FAQ has
my own personal opinion of things. While I'll be mostly objective about
things I'm going to occasionally say how I prefer things to be done.
Feel free to ignore me if you wish. I won't take any offence. <br>

 

      </p>

      
      <p>If you haven't come here with a specific question in mind the <a
 href="general.html">General 
Questions </a>
section is the place to start. This section covers how to get FreeSpace
and why the series never proceeded beyond the second instalment. The <a 
href="fred.html">FRED 
Questions </a> section aims to teach you everything you need to know to 
start making your own missions.  The <a 
href="modding.html">Modding 
Questions</a>
section gives an overview of how to make your own ships, weapons and
effects and get them into the game. Other aspects of modding for
FreeSpace are also covered. The <a 
href="gameplay.html">Gameplay
 Questions</a> section covers problems like how to play online or get 
promotions and medals. The <a 
href="technical.html">Technical
 Problems</a> section covers crashes or resolution problems.  The <a 
href="storyline.html">Storyline
 Questions</a> section contains transcripts of the cutscenes from FS2. 
<!--The <a href="hotu.html">HotU FAQ</a>
is designed for people who have downloaded their version of FreeSpace 2
from the Home of the Underdogs site. The first version available at
that site was around 200MB in size and had trimmed FS2 to the bone. As
a result there were lots of problems with it. The new version has
considerably less problems and may even give you less trouble than
installing FS2 from the CD.s--> <br>

 
 Lastly and possibly most importantly there is my <a 
href="installing.html">installation
 guide</a>.
This is basically a walkthrough of how to install FS2, FS2_Open and
modifications for the game. Unlike the version on the wiki it is
designed to be generic so that it goes out of date very slowly. <br>

      <h2>News</h2>
      
	  <span style="font-weight: bold;">04-10-08</span> - Now that GoG are 
supporting FS1 &amp; FS2 by making them legally available I'm removing 
any other links to the game since I fully support what they are trying 
to do. <br>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">06-05-07</span> - Another
massive gap between updates. Gotta stop doing that. Anyway gave the FAQ
a small update (hopefully the first of many). <br>

      </p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">08-12-06</span> - Wow, 
been a
while since I last updated. In view of the fact that I now have a new
domain for the FAQ I decided to do a little cleaning up. This isn't the
big change I've been promising for a while but that's coming reasonably
soon. Instead you get as many changes as I can make before I get sleepy.<br>

      
      </p><p><b>08-02-06</b> - Well those lovely people at HotU have
decided (with a little bit of a gentle shove from me) to upgrade their
version of FS2. Basically it's the full version except for cutscenes
available at their website. That's great news but it does mean that I
now need to comb through the entire FAQ and make sure that every single
reference to the old version is now updated. </p>

      
      <p><b>18-01-06</b> - Interesting. It appears I forgot to post
when I did take the old FAQ offline. I'd have thought a major change
like that would have gone in. Oh well this major change did get in. The
FAQ now contains a detailed guide on installing FS2, FS2_Open and mods
for FS2_Open. You can stop all bugging me in the forums now (only
joking. Bug me if there's anything I missed).
      </p>

      
      <p><b>06-08-05</b> - Time for another push. With luck I might be
able to get everything to the stage where I can take down the original
FAQ and replace it with this version. If not I'm going to upload what I
have and link to both the Beta site as well as the original from now
on. Thanks to Goober for correcting some of the errors in the cutscenes
section. No thanks for changing it all to American English but I've
changed it all back anyway!
      </p>

      
      <p><b>06-08-05</b> - I'm moving the location of the FAQ ever so
slightly. I don't much like having the FAQ, TMA and SoR all sharing the
same folder and with the number of new sections I've introduced it's
getting to be a bit of a mess. Time to tidy up a little. </p>

      
      <p><b>03-07-05</b> - Hmmmm. It's been a while since I uploaded
the page in response to HLP's disappearance and I've not changed much.
Time to do some work. Went through the HotU FAQ and found it
surprisingly current (I expected it to need lots of editing). That
means that the modding and technical sections are the only parts of the
original FAQ that need work. </p>

      
      <p><b>03-04-05</b> - Progress on the new version is still ongoing
but in response to the temporary disappearance of the forums on HLP I
decided to upload what I had so far. </p>

      
      <p> <b>19-03-05</b> - Big things are coming. FAQ v2.0 is well
under progress. Updates are done to the General, FRED, Gameplay, and
Storyline sections. Some of the features of FAQ V2.0 are a transcript
of all the FS1 cutscenes, more FRED help and for the first time the SCP
information is now separated out to make it easier to access. <br>

Planned features include a list of the FS1 missions detailing when each
ship became available (in a similar fashion to the FS2 one already
present), an in depth explanation of several of the new SCP SEXPs (with
examples of how they can be used to do things that were previously
impossible), a much larger SCP section covering many of the more common
bugs and workarounds, a glossary of common FreeSpace terms and an
enhanced downloads section which better details what can be found on
this site (cause sometimes I surprise myself with some of the useful
stuff I've uploaded and then forgotten about!). </p>

      
      <p><b>18-03-05</b> - Updates take time. The upgrade is now about
50% complete. Lots of new content added. The same ugly look remains
though. I've decided that I'm going to add all the new content and get
the FAQ up. Once I've done that I'll start thinking about improving the
quality of the HTML. </p>

      
      <p><b>06-02-05</b> - With my time on an average visit to HLP
climbing back up past the two hour mark it's become obvious that the
time has come to dust off the FAQ and revamp it properly for the SCP
era. Either that or start being a bit more hard-hearted and leave
people to find their own solutions. <br>

The result is that I'm reversing my long-standing position on SCP
information in the FAQ. I've been loathe to include much of it
previously because it tends to go out of date quickly resulting in me
having to edit all the time to keep the FAQ current. However it's
starting to look like it would be quicker to simply address SCP issues
here than it would be to keep answering individual queries on the SCP
forum. </p>
